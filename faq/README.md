### What is *the Context*?

*the Context* is a news website based on the information from Wikipedia Current Events Portal (News section), with occasional editorial content (Opinion section). It aims to be an Open Website, meaning access to it and its API is free, open, unmonitored, unlimited, possible in different formats (HTML, XML, JSON and Markdown) and licensed under a permissive [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License) license.

*the Context* does not use cookies, sessions or local storage. It does not use tracking or analytics. It does not display ads. It does not store access logs. It does not rate-limit access to the website or the API.

*the Context* is open source, with code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/thecontextnet/public). Each page change and history is stored individually on GitHub. Each page can be accessed securely with SSL or without it, for users who cannot use encryption.

### What kind of news it shows?

*the Context* displays current events selected by the Wikipedia Current Events Portal editors. The news items are short and unopinionated. Each item contains links to sources with full stories, usually an outside media organisation. Each item also contains links to related news discovered by *the Context* after analysing Wikipedia data. Our News section is maintained by robots.

This website also displays longer opinion editorials, written by different authors. The Opinion section is curated by Marek Foss, the Editor.
