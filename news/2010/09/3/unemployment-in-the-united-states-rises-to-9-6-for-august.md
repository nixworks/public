##### Unemployment rate
# Unemployment in the United States rises to 9.6% for August. 

The U.S. economy sheds 54,000 nonfarm jobs in August, fewer than forecast, as the health-care and temporary-staffing industries show expansion and thus soften the blow from the layoff of temporary Census workers.
