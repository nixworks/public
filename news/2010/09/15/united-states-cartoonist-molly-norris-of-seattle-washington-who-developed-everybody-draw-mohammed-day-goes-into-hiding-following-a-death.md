# United States cartoonist Molly Norris of Seattle, Washington, who developed Everybody Draw Mohammed Day, goes into hiding following a death threat from an Islamist radical. 

A cartoonist has disappeared from public view because she&#39;s on an Islamic cleric&#39;s hitlist for declaring &quot;Everybody Draw Mohammed Day&quot; last spring, according to a newspaper.
