##### Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
# Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the President of Indonesia, and Asif Ali Zardari, the President of Pakistan, call on President of the United States, Barack Obama, to stop International Burn a Koran Day being organised by the Dove World Outreach Center. 

Barack Obama has condemned an American pastor&rsquo;s plan to burn copies of the Koran on the ninth anniversary of September 11 as a &ldquo;recruitment bonanza for al-Qaeda&rdquo;, as outrage has built across the Islam world.
