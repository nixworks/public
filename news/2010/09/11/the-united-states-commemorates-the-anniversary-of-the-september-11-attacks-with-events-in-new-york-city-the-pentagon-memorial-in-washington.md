# The United States commemorates the anniversary of the September 11 attacks with events in New York City, the Pentagon Memorial in Washington D.C. and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, near where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed. 

Remembrance ceremonies, marred by tensions over a pastor&#039;s threat to burn the Koran, will take place on the ninth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
