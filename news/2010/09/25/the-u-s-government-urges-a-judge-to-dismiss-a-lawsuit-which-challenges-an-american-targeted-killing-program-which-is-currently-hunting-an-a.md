# The U.S. government urges a judge to dismiss a lawsuit which challenges an American targeted killing program which is currently hunting an American citizen who has no charges brought against him. 

The Obama administration on Saturday urged a federal judge to reject a challenge to a program that targets for killing U.S. citizens like Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki who have joined militant groups and have been tied to terrorism plots.
