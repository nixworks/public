# The People's Republic of China demands an apology from Japan after a recently detained fishing boat captain returns. Japan's Foreign Ministry rejects the call. 

Japan refused to apologize on Saturday for detaining a Chinese boat captain, showing no signs of softening in a dispute between the two economic powers after Japan gave ground and released him.
