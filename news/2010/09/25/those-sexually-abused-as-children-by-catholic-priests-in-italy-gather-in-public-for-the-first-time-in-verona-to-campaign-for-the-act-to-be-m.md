##### Verona
# Those sexually abused as children by Catholic priests in Italy gather in public for the first time in Verona to campaign for the act to be made a crime against humanity and to organise an international demonstration outside the Vatican next month. 

Victims of child abuse by Catholic priests in Italy have met for the first time, and called for such abuse to be made a crime against humanity.
