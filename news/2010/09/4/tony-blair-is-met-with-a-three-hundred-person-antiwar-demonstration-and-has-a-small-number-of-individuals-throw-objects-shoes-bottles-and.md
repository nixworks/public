##### Tony Blair
# Tony Blair is met with a three-hundred person antiwar demonstration and has a small number of individuals throw objects (shoes, bottles and eggs), and encounters an attempted citizen's arrest for war crimes at Eason's in Dublin, Ireland, at his first public book signing for "A Journey"; four are arrested. Clashes between protesters and police lead to the closure of businesses and the Luas tram system. 

Four people were arrested during minor scuffles between garda√≠ and anti-war protestors as former British prime minister Tony Blair arrived to sign copies of his autobiography in Dublin.
