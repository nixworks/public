# An Indonesian court upholds a 1965 blasphemy law which permits punishment for people or organisations that "distort" the orthodoxies of six officially recognised religions &mdash; Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Catholicism, Protestantism and Confucianism &mdash; and is criticized as a blow to permitting religious freedom. 

While applied to six recognized religions, the law is enforced mainly against those who stray from the teachings of mainstream Islam.
