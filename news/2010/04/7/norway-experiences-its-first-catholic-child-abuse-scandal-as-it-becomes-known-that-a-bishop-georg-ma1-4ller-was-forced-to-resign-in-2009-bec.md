# Norway experiences its first Catholic child abuse scandal as it becomes known that a bishop, Georg Muller, was forced to resign in 2009 because of sexual abuse of an altar boy in the early 1990s. 

In May, the leader of Norwayâ€™s small Catholic community resigned. The Vatican on Wednesday said why: he had sexually abused a boy in the early 1990s.
