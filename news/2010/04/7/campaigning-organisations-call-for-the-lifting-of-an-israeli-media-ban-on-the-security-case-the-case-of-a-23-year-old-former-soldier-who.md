# Campaigning organisations call for the lifting of an Israeli media ban on the "security case", the case of a 23-year-old former soldier who leaked details of extra-judicial killings of Palestinians. 

According to the group, military courts in Gaza sentenced 16 people to death in 2009 and so far this year, including eight convicted of treason.
