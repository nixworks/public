# FC Barcelona's Lionel Messi is widely hailed as the best footballer in the world after scoring four goals for the first time in his career in one UEFA Champions League game, including his fourth hat-trick of 2010. 

The legend at the Nou Camp reads &#034;mes que un club&#034; (more than a club) which has also now met its embodiment.
