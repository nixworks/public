# GetEQUAL activists shout at President of the United States Barack Obama while he is speaking, expressing their annoyance over the slow progress of repealing the ban on open homosexuality in the country's armed forces. 

Barack Obama was forced to interrupt a speech at a fundraising event after he was heckled over the &#039;don&#039;t ask, don&#039;t tell&#039; policy of homosexuals in the military.
