#  After Palestinians fire a Qassam rocket that explodes in an open area of the city of Ashkelon, Israeli planes launch air strikes on several targets in the Gaza Strip, in locations which include Gaza City, Khan Yunis and Rafah. 

Qassam explodes in open area just hours after Russia&#39;s Lavrov calls on Hamas&#39; Mashaal to stop &#39;unconscionable firing of rockets&#39; on Israel
