# Gunfire disrupts a rally in support of former President of Kyrgyzstan Kurmanbek Bakiyev in the southern city of Osh. 

Ousted President Kurmanbek Bakiyev fled Kyrgyzstan on Thursday and a government source said he had quit, a week after an uprising against his five-year rule sparked fears of civil war.
