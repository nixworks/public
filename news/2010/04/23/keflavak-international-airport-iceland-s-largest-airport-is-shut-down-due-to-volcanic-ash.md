##### Keflavik International Airport
# Keflavik International Airport, Iceland's largest airport, is shut down due to volcanic ash. 

Iceland, able to keep its airports open while European airlines were grounded due to ash from its volcanic eruption, is now closing its airspace because of a change in wind direction, authorities said on Thursday.
