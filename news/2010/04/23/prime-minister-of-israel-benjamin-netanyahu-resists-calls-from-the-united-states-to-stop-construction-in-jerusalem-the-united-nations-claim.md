##### Prime Minister
# Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu resists calls from the United States to stop construction in Jerusalem; the United Nations claims Israel's blockade of Gaza prevents it from educating thousands of Palestinian children. 

Israel&#39;s prime minister on Thursday rejected U.S. calls to halt construction in disputed East Jerusalem, clouding a new peace mission by Washington&#39;s Mideast envoy.
