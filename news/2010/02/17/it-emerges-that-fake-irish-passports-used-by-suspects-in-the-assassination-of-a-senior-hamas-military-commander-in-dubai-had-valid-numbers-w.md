# It emerges that fake Irish passports used by suspects in the assassination of a senior Hamas military commander in Dubai had valid numbers with mismatched identities, with the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs embarking on an urgent mission to track the three genuine passport holders with these numbers. 

Three of the Irish passports used by those responsible for the killing of a senior Hamas figure in Dubai last month carried genuine passport numbers.
