# Brazil and Zimbabwe play a football game in front of a sell-out crowd in Harare ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, the first time since independence that a non-African team has performed in the country. President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai both attend and civil servants are given time off work. 

Brazil defeated Zimbabwe 3-0 in a World Cup warmup on Wednesday in Harare, Zimbabwe, thanks to goals from Michel Bastos, Robinho and Elano.
