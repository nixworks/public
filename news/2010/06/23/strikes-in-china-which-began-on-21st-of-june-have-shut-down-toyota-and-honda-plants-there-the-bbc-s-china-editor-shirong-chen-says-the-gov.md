# Strikes in China which began on 21st of June have shut down Toyota and Honda plants there. "The BBC's China editor Shirong Chen says the government has tolerated strikes at foreign-owned plants, which are obliged to respect workers' rights, but maintains strict control at Chinese-owned factories for fear of widespread social unrest." 

Strikes have halted work at two Japanese-owned car assembly factories in China - the latest in a wave of labour disputes.
