# A report by the Police Service of Northern Ireland's Historical Enquiries Team concludes that a British soldier who fatally shot a 41-year-old civilian in Derry in 1971 acted "unlawfully", as the civilian "was not carrying a firearm and he posed no threat to the soldiers". 

The soldier who killed a man in 1971 should have been charged with murder, the chief of the RUC in the city said at the time.
