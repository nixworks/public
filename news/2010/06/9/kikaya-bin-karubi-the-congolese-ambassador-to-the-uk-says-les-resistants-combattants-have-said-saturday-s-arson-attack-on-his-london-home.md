# Kikaya Bin Karubi, the Congolese ambassador to the UK, says Les Resistants Combattants have said Saturday's arson attack on his London home, which destroyed several vehicles and damaged his house, was an act of retaliation for last week's death of leading human rights activist Floribert Chebeya. 

Congolese ambassador to the UK tells the BBC opposition activists may have been behind an arson attack on his London home.
