##### United Nations
# Israel asks the United Nations to suspend attempts to organise an international inquiry into the Gaza flotilla raid, with Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak saying "some organisation, probably backed by a terror organisation, (is) once again trying to send a vessel into Gaza." 

Israel asks the UN to ditch an international inquiry into an Israeli raid on a ship trying to break the Gaza blockade.
