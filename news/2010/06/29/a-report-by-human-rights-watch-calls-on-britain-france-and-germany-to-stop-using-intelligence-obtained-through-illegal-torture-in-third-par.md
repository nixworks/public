# A report by Human Rights Watch calls on Britain, France and Germany to stop using intelligence obtained through illegal torture in third-party countries, saying that it contradicts the European Union's anti-torture guidelines and is self-defeating in the "fight against terrorism". 

UK, France and Germany urged not to use information gained by torture in other countries.
