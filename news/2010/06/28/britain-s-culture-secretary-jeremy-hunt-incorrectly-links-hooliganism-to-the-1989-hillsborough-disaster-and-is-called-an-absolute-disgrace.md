##### Jeremy Hunt
# Britain's Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt incorrectly links hooliganism to the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster, and is called "an absolute disgrace" by families of those who were killed. 

A government minister apologised on Monday after he appeared to suggest that crowd trouble was a cause of the 1989 Hillsborough soccer stadium disaster in which 96 Liverpool fans were killed.
