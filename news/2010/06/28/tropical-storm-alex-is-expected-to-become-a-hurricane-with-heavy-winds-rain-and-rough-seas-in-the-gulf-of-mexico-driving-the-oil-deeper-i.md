##### Hurricane Alex
# Tropical Storm Alex is expected to become a hurricane, with heavy winds, rain and rough seas in the Gulf of Mexico, driving the oil deeper inland and bringing much of the cleanup to a standstill. 

Tropical Storm Alex was close to hurricane strength in the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday but remained on a track north of Mexican oil platforms and far southwest of U.S. fields, further easing crude market concerns over supply disruption.
