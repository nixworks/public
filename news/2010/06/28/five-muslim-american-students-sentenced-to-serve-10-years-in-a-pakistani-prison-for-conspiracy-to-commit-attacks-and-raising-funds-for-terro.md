# Five Muslim American students sentenced to serve 10 years in a Pakistani prison for conspiracy to commit attacks and raising funds for terrorism, appeal their conviction. 

Five American men sentenced last week to serve 10 years in a Pakistani prison on terrorism charges appealed against their conviction Monday, their defense lawyer said. The five Americans, all students in their 20s, were sentenced Thursday for contacting militants online and plotting attacks by a court in Pakistan, fighting its own battle with Islamist radicals.
