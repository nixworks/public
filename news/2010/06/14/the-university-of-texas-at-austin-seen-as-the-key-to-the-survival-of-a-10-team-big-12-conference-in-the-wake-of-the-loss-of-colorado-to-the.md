# The University of Texas at Austin, seen as the key to the survival of a 10-team Big 12 Conference in the wake of the loss of Colorado to the Pacific-10 Conference and Nebraska to the Big Ten Conference, announces it will turn down an invitation from the Pac-10 and remain in the Big 12. Shortly after Texas' announcement, four other Texas and Oklahoma schools targeted by the Pac-10 pledge themselves to the Big 12. 

Texas will remain a Big 12 Conference member, the university announced on Monday.
