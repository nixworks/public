# United States astronauts Douglas H. Wheelock and Tracy Caldwell Dyson fail on the International Space Station (ISS)'s longest spacewalk and sixth longest spacewalk to repair a cooling system, which means two more spacewalks are now required. 

Two International Space Station astronauts achieve only &quot;partial success&quot; in efforts to repair a cooling system, and two more spacewalks will be needed.
