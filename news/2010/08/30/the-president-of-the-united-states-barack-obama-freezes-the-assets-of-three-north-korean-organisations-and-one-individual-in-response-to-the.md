# The President of the United States Barack Obama freezes the assets of three North Korean organisations and one individual in response to the sinking of a South Korean warship in March. North Korea has denied it is responsible. 

Expanded assets freeze list is part of a punishment over the sinking of the South Korean warship earlier this year.
