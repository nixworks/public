# Angola jails 4 human rights activists - a university professor, priest, lawyer and former police officer - for alleged links to the perpetrators of the Togo national football team attack; Amnesty International and other organisations describe it as a crackdown on criticism. 

Angola sentences four human rights activists for reported links with a separatist group which carried out an attack on the Togolese football team in January.
