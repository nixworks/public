##### American Civil Liberties Union
# The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) both sue the United States (US) after it bans lawyers from a case taken by the father of Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki against the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which has labelled him a "specially designated global terrorist". 

A civil rights group files a legal challenge to obtain a licence to represent Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in a case against the CIA.
