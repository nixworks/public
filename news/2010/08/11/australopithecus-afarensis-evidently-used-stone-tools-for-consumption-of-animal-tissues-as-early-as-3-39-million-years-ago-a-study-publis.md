##### Australopithecus afarensis
# "Australopithecus afarensis" evidently used stone tools for consumption of animal tissues as early as 3.39 million years ago, a study published in "Nature" finds. 

Researchers have unearthed evidence that our ancestors used tools and ate meat 800,000 years earlier than thought.
