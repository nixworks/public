# Venezuela's government begins a trial ban of the publication of "violent, bloody or grotesque" photographs in newspapers, as a result of controversy over pictures of bloodied corpses riddled with bullets appear on the front page of newspapers. 

A month-long ban begins in Venezuela on national newspapers printing &quot;violent, bloody or grotesque&quot; images, following a government-backed court action.
