# A school building collapses due to heavy rain in the village of Sumgarh in the Indian state of Uttarakhand, killing at least 17 schoolchildren. 

Eighteen Class V students in a primary school run by RSS were buried alive and eight others injured on Wednesday when the roof of the building collapsed after a massive rock crashed into it from a hillside during landslides trigerred by torrential rains in Uttarakhand.
