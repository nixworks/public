# The United States is hit by a salmonella scare, with hundreds of people now thought to be ill across the country due to bad eggs; poisoning is expected to increase in the coming weeks. 

Salmonella-infected eggs traceable to a large producer in Iowa may have caused as many as 1200 cases of intestinal illness in at least 10 US states in recent weeks.
