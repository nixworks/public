# Israel's ambassador to the United Nations Gabriela Shalev writes a letter to Ban Ki-moon stating that Israel would use force against a Bolivian-flagged all-female aid ship intending to land near Gaza. 

Israel says it could use force to stop a new aid boat to Gaza, as Lebanon refuses to bow to warnings against authorising an all-women ship to head for the blockaded Palestinian territory.
