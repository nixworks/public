# Usain Bolt is professionally defeated for only the second time in the 100 metres by Tyson Gay in Stockholm. 

Usain Bolt, unrecognisable from the man who has been rewriting the record books for two years, was given a timely reminder by Tyson Gay in the Diamond League meeting in Stockholm on Friday night that he can never assume victory when they go head to head.
