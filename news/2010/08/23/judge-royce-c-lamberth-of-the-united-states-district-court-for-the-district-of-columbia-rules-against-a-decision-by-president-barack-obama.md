##### Royce C. Lamberth
# Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia rules against a decision by President Barack Obama allowing the expansion of embryonic stem cell research claiming it breaks US law. 

Federal funding for embryonic stem cell studies in the U.S. is again under attack after a judge blocked President Barack Obamaâ€™s expanded rules for scientists, potentially disrupting the field and discouraging new research.
