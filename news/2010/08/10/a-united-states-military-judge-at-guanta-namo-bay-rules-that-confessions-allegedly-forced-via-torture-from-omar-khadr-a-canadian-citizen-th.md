# A United States military judge at Guantanamo Bay rules that confessions allegedly forced via torture from Omar Khadr, a Canadian citizen they accuse of terrorism after his 2002 capture at the age of 15, count as evidence in his trial. 

Alleged confessions of a Canadian being held at Guantanamo Bay can be heard at his trial, a US military judge has ruled.
