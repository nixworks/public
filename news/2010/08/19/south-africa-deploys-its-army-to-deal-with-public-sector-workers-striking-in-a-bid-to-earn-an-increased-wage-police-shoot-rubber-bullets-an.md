# South Africa deploys its army to deal with public sector workers striking in a bid to earn an increased wage; police shoot rubber bullets and water cannon into crowds outside a hospital in Soweto. At least five people have been killed so far during the strikes. 

Military doctors, nurses and soldiers have been sent to hospitals at the request of Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi as the strike intensified.
