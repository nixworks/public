Sharks, Atlantic cod, and Pacific sardines are tapped as particularly imperilled with extinction. The scientists recommend drastic measures to reduce ocean fishing. ](/news/2003/05/15/the-journal-nature-reports-that-all-species-of-large-fish-in-the-world-s-oceans-have-been-so-thoroughly-overfished-that-just-10-of-the-p.md) _Context: ocean_
