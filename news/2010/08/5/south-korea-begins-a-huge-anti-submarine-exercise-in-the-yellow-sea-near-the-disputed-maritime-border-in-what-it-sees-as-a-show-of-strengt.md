##### South Korea
# South Korea begins a huge anti-submarine exercise in the Yellow Sea, near the disputed maritime border, in what it sees as a show of strength against North Korea and "to be fully prepared for combat"; North Korea disapproves of the exercise. 

South Korea starts a huge anti-submarine exercise amid continuing anger over the sinking of a warship, despite warnings of retaliation from the North.
