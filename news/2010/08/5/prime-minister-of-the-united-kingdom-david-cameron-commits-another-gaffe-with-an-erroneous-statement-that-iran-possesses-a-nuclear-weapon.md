##### Prime Minister
# Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron commits another gaffe - with an erroneous statement that Iran possesses a nuclear weapon - just after apologising to an angered pensioner for his previous gaffe about the Battle of Britain. 

Labour accuses David Cameron of making &quot;another foreign policy gaffe&quot; after mistakenly saying Iran has a nuclear weapon.
