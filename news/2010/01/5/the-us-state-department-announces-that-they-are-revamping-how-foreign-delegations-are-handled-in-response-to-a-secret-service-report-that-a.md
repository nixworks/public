# The US State Department announces that they are revamping how foreign delegations are handled, in response to a Secret Service report that a third man had crashed the state dinner for the Prime Minister of India. 

A third uninvited guest made it into a White House state dinner in honor of the Indian prime minister, but there is no evidence the person had contact with the president or first lady, the Secret Service said on Monday.
