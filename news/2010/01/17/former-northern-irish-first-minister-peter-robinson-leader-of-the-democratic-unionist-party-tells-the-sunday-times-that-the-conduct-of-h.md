##### Northern Ireland
# Former Northern Irish First Minister Peter Robinson, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, tells "The Sunday Times" that the conduct of his wife, politician Iris Robinson, with her young lover has led him to shake hands with deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness (Sinn Fein) for the first time. 

The revelations about Peter Robinson&#39;s wife Iris have indirectly led to a political first for a DUP leader - a handshake with Martin McGuinness.
