# A United States bankruptcy judge orders Bank of America to return $500 million it seized from the bank accounts of the defunct Lehman Brothers trading firm a few weeks before Lehman declared bankruptcy in 2008. 

Barclays Plc said disputes over an $11 billion profit it allegedly made buying bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s brokerage may not all be resolved in a current trial and might need “further adjudication.”
