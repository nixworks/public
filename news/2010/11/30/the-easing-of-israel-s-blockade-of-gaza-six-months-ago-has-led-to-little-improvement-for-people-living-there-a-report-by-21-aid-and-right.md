# The easing of Israel's blockade of Gaza six months ago has led to "little improvement" for people living there, a report by 21 aid and rights agencies says; Israeli officials says that the claims "are biased and distorted" and that truckloads of supplies entering the Gaza Strip has increased from 86 to 176 truckloads per day, since June.
