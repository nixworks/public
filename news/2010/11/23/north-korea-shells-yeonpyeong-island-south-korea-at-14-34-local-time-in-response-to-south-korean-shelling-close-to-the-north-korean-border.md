# North Korea shells Yeonpyeong island, South Korea at 14:34 local time in response to South Korean shelling close to the North Korean border during military drills. The North's shelling kills two marines and prompts a military response by the South in one of the most serious clashes since the 1953 armistice of the Korean War. 

North and South Korea fire artillery shells across their tense western sea border, in one of the most serious clashes since the Korean War in the 1950s.
