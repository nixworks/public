# Pope Benedict XVI says his personal opinion is that condoms may be used "in exceptional cases" to combat HIV-AIDS, but the Vatican says it has not changed its policy on contraception. 

Catholic writer Austin Ivereigy explains that using condoms as a contraception is still forbidden by the Catholic Church, despite the Pope&#039;s recent comments about the use of condoms to prevent infection.
