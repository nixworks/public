# An Israeli military court demotes two Givati Brigade staff sergeants to sergeant after convicting them of forcing a nine-year-old Palestinian boy to open two bags thought to contain explosives. 

Two Israeli soldiers who used a Palestinian child as a human shield during an offensive in Gaza receive suspended sentences and are demoted.
