##### Delaware
# An examiner appointed by the Delaware Bankruptcy court says that there is no value left in the estate of defunct bank Washington Mutual for the stockholders to receive anything. 

Shareholders of Washington Mutual Inc are &quot;highly unlikely&quot; to recover anything from the bankruptcy stemming from the biggest bank failure in U.S. history, a court-appointed examiner said on Monday.
