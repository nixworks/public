##### WikiLeaks
# The WikiLeaks website is attacked by a computer-hacking operation and undergoes "a mass distributed denial of service attack" as it prepares to release more secret U.S. documents. Julian Assange says U.S. authorities are afraid of being held accountable for their actions. 

Whistle-blowing website Wikileaks says it is under attack from a computer-hacking operation ahead of a suspected release of secret US government documents.
