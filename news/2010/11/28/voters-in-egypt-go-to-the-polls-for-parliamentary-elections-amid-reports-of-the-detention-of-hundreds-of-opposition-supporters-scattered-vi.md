##### Egypt
# Voters in Egypt go to the polls for parliamentary elections amid reports of the detention of hundreds of opposition supporters, scattered violence, vote buying and the ejection of independent monitors as the government cracks down on the opposition; 21 people are wounded in skirmishes connected with the poll. 

Egypt’s ruling party is set to tighten its grip on power after today’s parliamentary election, dealing a blow to its main Islamist rival whose candidates accused authorities of rigging the vote.
