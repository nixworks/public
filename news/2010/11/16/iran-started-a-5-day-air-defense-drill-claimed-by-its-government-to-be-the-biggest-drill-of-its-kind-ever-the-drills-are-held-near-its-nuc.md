# Iran started a 5-day air defense drill, claimed by its government to be the biggest drill of its kind ever. The drills are held near its nuclear facilities. 

Iran began what it said was its biggest ever air defense drill on Tuesday to test its ability to deter air strikes, which the United States and Israel have not ruled out to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons.
