##### Iceland
# Iceland opens an inquiry as it emerges that its citizens may be being spied on by the United States embassy. This follows similar investigations into possible illegal U.S. activities in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland, with possibly hundreds of Norwegians being monitored and Sweden describing the matter as "very serious". 

Iceland becomes the latest Nordic country to investigate whether its citizens are being spied on by the US embassy.
