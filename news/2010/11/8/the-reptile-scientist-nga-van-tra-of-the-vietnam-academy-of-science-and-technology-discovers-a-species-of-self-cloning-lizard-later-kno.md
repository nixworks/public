##### Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology
# The reptile scientist, Ngo Van Tri of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, discovers a species of self-cloning lizard later known as "Leiolepis ngovantrii" when he came across tanks full of them at small restaurants in rural villages in Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province. Ngo Van Tri becomes intrigued when he notices that all of the lizards appeared to be female.
