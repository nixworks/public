##### Palm Sunday
# At a Palm Sunday mass in Saint Peter's Square, Rome, Pope Benedict XVI tells tens of thousands of people about the recent "petty gossip" he has been subjected to, thought to mean the child sexual abuse within the Roman Catholic Church, though he fails to directly mention the scandal. 

Cardinal Seán Brady has said a parish priest in his diocese has agreed to take leave in light of information relating to child safeguarding issues.
