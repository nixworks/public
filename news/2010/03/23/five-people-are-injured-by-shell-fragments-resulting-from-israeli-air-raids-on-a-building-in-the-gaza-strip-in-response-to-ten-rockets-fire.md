# Five people are injured by shell fragments resulting from Israeli air raids on a building in the Gaza Strip, in response to ten rockets fired into Israel from the Gaza Strip since Thursday. 

The man was shot by fellow soldiers along the Gaza border in an operation aimed at stopping three Palestinians who were thought to be trying to infiltrate the border fence, an army spokesman said.
