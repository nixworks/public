# In the United Kingdom, BBC Director General Mark Thompson confirms plans to close BBC 6 Music and the BBC Asian Network as part of a cost-cutting drive. The proposals will also see BBC Radio 7 rebranded as "BBC Radio 4 Extra" and cutbacks to the BBC website. 

The BBC will spend 90p of every licence fee pound on programmes, according to Mark Thompson, the head of the corporation.
