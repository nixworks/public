##### Omar al-Bashir
# Many international leaders stay away from the inauguration of Omar al-Bashir, wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes in Darfur, as he is sworn in as President of Sudan but at least five African presidents attend the event along with two UN representatives. 

Government says it will instead prosecute leaders of the anti-government group.
