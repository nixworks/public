# Singapore closes beaches along 7.2 kilometers (4.5 miles) of its east coast as an oil spill from the damaged Malaysian tanker MT "Bunga Kelana 3" continues to spread. 

Singapore closed most of its eastern beaches due to the oil spilt in nearby waters following a collision between a tanker and a bulk carrier earlier this week, the environmental agency said on Thursday.
