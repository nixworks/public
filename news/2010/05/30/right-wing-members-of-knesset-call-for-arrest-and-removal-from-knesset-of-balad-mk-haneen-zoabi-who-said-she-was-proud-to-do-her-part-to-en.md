# Right-wing members of Knesset call for arrest and removal from Knesset of Balad MK Haneen Zoabi, who said she was proud to do her part to end what she called a siege on Gaza.

Activists aboard an aid flotilla say they have left Cyprus and will reach Gaza on Monday, but Israel says it will not let them in.
