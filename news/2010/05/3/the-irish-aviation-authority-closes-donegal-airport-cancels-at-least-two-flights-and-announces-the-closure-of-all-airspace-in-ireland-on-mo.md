##### Irish Aviation Authority
# The Irish Aviation Authority closes Donegal Airport, cancels at least two flights and announces the closure of all airspace in Ireland on Monday due to Icelandic volcanic ash, while British Airports, including some in Scotland, may also be affected due to continued eruptions of Eyjafjallajokull volcano. 

Irish airspace will close from 7am tomorrow because of an ash cloud drifting down from Iceland.
