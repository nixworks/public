##### Texas Education Agency
# The Texas Education Agency adopts controversial changes to the Texas public school curriculum, including dropping coverage of enlightenment thinker Thomas Jefferson and suggesting United Nations is a "threat to freedom". The proposal to refer to the slave trade as the "Atlantic triangular trade" is not implemented. 

Texas adopts a school curriculum which critics say will politicise teaching by demonising the UN and celebrating the free market.
