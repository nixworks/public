##### By-election
# A by-election takes place in Hong Kong triggered by activists calling for universal suffrage in the territory. 

Hong Kong voted in citywide by-elections on Sunday, polls which pro-democracy groups consider to be a de facto referendum on universal suffrage aimed at pressuring Beijing to grant swifter political reforms.
