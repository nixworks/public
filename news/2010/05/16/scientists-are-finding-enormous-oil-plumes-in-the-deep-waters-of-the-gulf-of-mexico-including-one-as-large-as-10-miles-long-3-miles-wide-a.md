##### Gulf of Mexico
# Scientists are finding enormous oil plumes in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, including one as large as 10 miles long, 3 miles wide and 300 feet thick in spots as fresh evidence that the leak from the broken undersea well could be substantially worse than estimates that the United States government and BP have given. 

The discovery of the plumes, one as large as 10 miles long, is evidence that the leak could be substantially worse than estimates.
