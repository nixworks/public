##### Dahlonega, Georgia
# A white teacher in Dahlonega, Georgia is suspended after permitting non-black students to bring bed sheets and cone-shaped party hats to school to dress in the traditional costume of right-wing white supremacist nationalist organisation Ku Klux Klan for a film project. She refuses to apologise after the issue is raised by African-American students when one of them was asked to take part in a re-enactment of a lynching. 

A US teacher is suspended from duty after allowing pupils to don Ku Klux Klan robes for a class project, prompting a row.
