# Increased tensions over the sinking of the South Korean warship ROKS Cheonan (PCC-772): South Korea begins broadcasting propaganda over its border with North Korea. North Korea severs all ties and communications with the South and expels Southern workers from a jointly-run factory above the border. 

North Korea is to sever all ties with its southern neighbour, as tensions escalate over the sinking of a South Korean ship.
