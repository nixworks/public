# Thailand's Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and anti-government "Red Shirt" protesters reach a qualified agreement to hold general elections in November, but questions over the dissolution of parliament prevent an end to the two-month standoff in central Bangkok. 

Thailand&#039;s anti-government protesters have given tacit support to a plan for reconciliation, but will continue protesting for now.
