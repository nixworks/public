##### Deepwater Horizon oil spill
# Tar balls from the Gulf oil disaster reach Louisiana's Lake Pontchartrain and the shores of Texas near Galveston, on day 77 of the disaster. 

Laboratory tests showed that the tar balls came from the BP Macondo well that blew out April 20, killing 11 crew members on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and spewing millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf, said Coast Guard Cpt. Landryâ€™s has lost millions in sales and suffered from higher seafood pricing since the spill occurred, he said, adding that the company is reviewing possible claims against BP. Officials said tar balls are common along the Texas coast because of natural seepage from the Gulf or from small oil spills. The dozen tar balls found in the surf Saturday ranged from the size of a dime to a golf ball, said Richard Arnhart, oil spill response regional director for the Texas General Land Office. A Gilchrist resident reported the tar balls Saturday, and the General Land Office received multiple reports Sunday, said Wesley McDaniel, Land Office oil response officer. Officials were investigating whether the tar balls were from oil that clung to the hull of a ship passing through the BP oil slick or were from ballast water taken on by a ship in the oil slick zone and later dumped in Texas waters, Woodring said.
