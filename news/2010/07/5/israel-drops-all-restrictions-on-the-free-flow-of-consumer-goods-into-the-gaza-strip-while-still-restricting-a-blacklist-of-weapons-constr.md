# Israel drops all restrictions on the free flow of consumer goods into the Gaza Strip, while still restricting a blacklist of weapons, construction materials and dual-use items. These materials will be allowed into the territory with the coordination of international agencies. 

Consumer goods allowed into enclave but tight limits remain on construction materials.
