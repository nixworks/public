##### Hurricane Alex
# Hurricane Alex, the first hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, makes landfall in northeastern Mexico as a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km-h), and causes tornadoes that force people into shelters in southern Texas. 

Storm makes landfall as heavy seas hamper oil clean-up efforts in Gulf of Mexico.
