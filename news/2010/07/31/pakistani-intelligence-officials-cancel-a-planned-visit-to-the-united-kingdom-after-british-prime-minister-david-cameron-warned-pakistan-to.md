# Pakistani intelligence officials cancel a planned visit to the United Kingdom after British Prime Minister David Cameron warned Pakistan to avoid links with groups that "promote the export of terror". However, a visit by President Asif Ali Zardari will go ahead. 

Pakistan says it expects &quot;fruitful&quot; talks between its president and David Cameron despite a row over comments about its alleged links to terror.
