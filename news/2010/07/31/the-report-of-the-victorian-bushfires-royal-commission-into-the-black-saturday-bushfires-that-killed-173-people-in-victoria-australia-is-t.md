##### Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission
# The report of the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission into the Black Saturday bushfires that killed 173 people in Victoria, Australia, is tabled in the Parliament of Victoria. It contains 67 recommendations including changes to evacuation policy and an increase in backburning. 

Almost more important than what is in the Black Saturday report is whether its recommendations will be implemented.
