Soldiers&#x20;from&#x20;13&#x20;former&#x20;French&#x20;African&#x20;colonies&#x20;will&#x20;march&#x20;down&#x20;the&#x20;Champs&#x20;Elys&#x00E9;es&#x20;in&#x20;Paris&#x20;on&#x20;July&#x20;14&#x20;as&#x20;part&#x20;of&#x20;France&#x2019;s&#x20;Bastille&#x20;Day&#x20;celebrations.&#x20;However,&#x20;human&#x20;rights&#x20;groups&#x20;are&#x20;concerned&#x20;that&#x20;some&#x20;of&#x20;the&#x20;soldiers&#x20;involved&#x20;may&#x20;be&#x20;war&#x20;criminals.
