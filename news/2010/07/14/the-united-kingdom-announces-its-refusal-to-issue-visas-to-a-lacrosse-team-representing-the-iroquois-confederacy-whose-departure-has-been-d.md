# The United Kingdom announces its refusal to issue visas to a lacrosse team representing the Iroquois Confederacy, whose departure has been delayed since Friday, after the United States Department of State earlier in the day cleared the team's departure with tribal passports. The UK stated that it will only recognise passports from the United States or Canada. 

The Iroquois national lacrosse team received permission on Wednesday from the State Department to travel on tribal passports, but England refused to grant visas.
