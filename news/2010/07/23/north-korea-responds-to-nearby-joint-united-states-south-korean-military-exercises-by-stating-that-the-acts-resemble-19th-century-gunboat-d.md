# North Korea responds to nearby joint United States-South Korean military exercises by stating that the acts resemble 19th century "gunboat diplomacy", describing them as "a threat to the Korean peninsula and the region of Asia as a whole". 

North Korea says it will use its &quot;nuclear deterrent&quot; in response to joint US-South Korean military exercises this weekend.
