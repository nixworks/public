# Tunisia jails Fahem Boukadous, the journalist who covered violent protests in Gafsa in 2008. Boukadous was already in hospital with breathing problems before his jailing. 

A Tunisian court has sentenced a television journalist to four years in prison for reporting information deemed threatening to the public order, his lawyer says.
