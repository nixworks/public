# New Zealand environmental activist Peter Bethune is given a two year suspended sentence in a Tokyo District Court for his role in boarding a Japanese whaling ship. 

When Pete Bethune&#039;s family in Auckland heard the New Zealand environmental activist had been sentenced in Tokyo, they thought he was going to be locked up in Japan for two years.
