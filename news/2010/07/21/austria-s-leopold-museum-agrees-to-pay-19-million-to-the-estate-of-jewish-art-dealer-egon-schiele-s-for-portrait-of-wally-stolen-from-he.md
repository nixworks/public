# Austria's Leopold Museum agrees to pay $19 million to the estate of Jewish art dealer Egon Schiele's for "Portrait of Wally", stolen from her by Nazism in World War II. 

A 12-year dispute has ended with an agreement that a 1912 oil painting will be returned to a Vienna museum and displayed with an acknowledgement that it was stolen from a Jewish art dealer by a Nazi agent.
