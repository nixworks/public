# Thousands of mourners gather in Zahedan for a mass funeral for those killed in recent bombings; Iranian officials indicate that they believe the West carried out the atrocities. 

Iran blamed the West and Israel on Saturday for twin suicide bombings which killed at least 27 people, despite condemnation of the attack by the European Union, United Nations and United States.
