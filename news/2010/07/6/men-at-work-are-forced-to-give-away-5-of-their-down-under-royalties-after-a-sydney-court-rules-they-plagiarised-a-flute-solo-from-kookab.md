##### Men at Work
# Men at Work are forced to give away 5% of their "Down Under" royalties after a Sydney court rules they plagiarised a flute solo from "Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree". 

Australian pop group Men at Work have been ordered to hand over five per cent of the royalties from their 1980s hit song Down Under after a judge ruled they had copied part of the tune from a children&#039;s campfire song.
