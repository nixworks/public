# Right-wing Israeli politicians push for a controversial change to the wording of the oath required to become an Israeli citizen, amending the wording so that potential citizens must promise to respect Israel as a "Jewish and democratic state". 

Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu re-introduces a controversial proposal to require new citizens to take an oath of loyalty to the Jewish state.
