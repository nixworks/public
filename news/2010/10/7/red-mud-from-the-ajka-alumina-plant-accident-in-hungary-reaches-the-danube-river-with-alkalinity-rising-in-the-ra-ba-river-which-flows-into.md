##### Red mud
# Red mud from the Ajka alumina plant accident in Hungary reaches the Danube River with alkalinity rising in the Raba River which flows into the Danube. 

Toxic red sludge from a Hungarian alumina plant reached the Danube on Thursday and crews struggled to dilute it to protect the river from what the prime minister called an &quot;unprecedented ecological catastrophe.&quot;
