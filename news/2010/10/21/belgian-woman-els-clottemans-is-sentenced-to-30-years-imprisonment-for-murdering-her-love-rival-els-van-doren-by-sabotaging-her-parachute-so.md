# Belgian woman Els Clottemans is sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for murdering her love rival Els Van Doren by sabotaging her parachute so neither it nor a safety chute would open during a November 18, 2006 parachute jump. 

A jealous schoolteacher who doctored the parachute of a love rival causing her to plunge to her death was sentenced to 30 years in prison Thursday.
