# Gunmen torch up to 40 oil tanker trucks carrying fuel for NATO forces in Afghanistan in Quetta and Nowshera, Pakistan and kill a truck driver. The Tehreek-e-Taliban claimed responsibility for that and other attacks. This was the sixth attack on convoys taking supplies to Afghanistan since Pakistan closed a key border crossing almost a week ago. 

The U.S. apologized Wednesday for a recent helicopter attack that killed two Pakistani soldiers at an outpost near the Afghan border, saying American pilots mistook the soldiers for insurgents they were pursuing.
