# Iran says two foreigners arrested for interviewing the son of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani had connections to "anti-revolutionary" groups abroad. 

Two foreigners who interviewed the son of a woman prisoner at the centre of a international row were arrested by Iran because the pair had links with &quot;anti-revolutionary&quot; networks abroad, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Tuesday.
