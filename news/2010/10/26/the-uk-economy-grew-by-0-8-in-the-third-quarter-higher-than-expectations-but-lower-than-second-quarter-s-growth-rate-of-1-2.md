##### Economy of the United Kingdom
# The UK economy grew by 0.8% in the third quarter, higher than expectations, but lower than second quarter's growth rate of 1.2%. 

George Osborne says better-than-expected economic figures show the recovery is &quot;steady&quot;, but Labour warns that spending cuts will damage performance.
