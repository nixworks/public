# The United States has fallen to a new low of 22nd place in Transparency International's rating of the least corrupt nations, noting various financial scandals and a lack of regulation leading to power being bought. 

The United States has dropped out of the &quot;top 20&quot; in a global league table of least corrupt nations, tarnished by financial scandals and the influence of money in politics, Transparency International said on Tuesday.
