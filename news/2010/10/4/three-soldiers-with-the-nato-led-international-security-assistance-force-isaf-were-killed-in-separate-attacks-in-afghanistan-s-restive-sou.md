# Three soldiers with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) were killed in separate attacks in Afghanistan's restive southern and eastern regions. 

Three people were killed on Monday and up to eight others wounded when about 20 NATO oil tankers were attacked and set ablaze near the Pakistani capital, in the second mass torching in days.
