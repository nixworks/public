##### Visa Inc.
# Visa and MasterCard agreed to settle an antitrust lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice and the attorneys-general of seven states. They agreed to allow their participating merchants to steer customers toward lower-cost options. American Express will fight rather than agree to the terms, it said. 

The suit centers on rules and fees the companies impose on merchants. They are charged with making it difficult for businesses to allow alternative forms of payment.
