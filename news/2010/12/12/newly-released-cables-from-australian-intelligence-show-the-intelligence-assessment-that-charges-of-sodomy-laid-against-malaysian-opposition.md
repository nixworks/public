# Newly released cables from Australian intelligence show the intelligence assessment that charges of sodomy laid against Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim are due to a "set up job" that he "walked into". Others refer to Malaysia as a "confused and dangerous" state, Thai politicians as corrupt and Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn as "very erratic and easily subject to influence", and Japan as a "big fat loser". 

Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim&#039;s sodomy charges are the result of a &#039;set up job&#039; that the politician &#039;walked into&#039;, according to intelligence.
