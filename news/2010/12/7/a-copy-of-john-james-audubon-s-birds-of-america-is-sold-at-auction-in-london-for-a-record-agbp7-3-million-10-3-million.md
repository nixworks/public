# A copy of John James Audubon's "Birds of America" is sold at auction in London for a record GBP7.3 million ($10.3 million). 

A new record was set for the world&#039;s most expensive printed book at an auction yesterday. A four-volume copy of John James Audubon&#039;s Birds of America went for £7,321,250 at Sotheby&#039;s in London, surpassing the previous record of £5,565,110 – held by another copy of the same title – and beating the estimate of £4-£6m. The proud new owner, the London dealer Michael Tollemache, described the work as &quot;priceless&quot;.
