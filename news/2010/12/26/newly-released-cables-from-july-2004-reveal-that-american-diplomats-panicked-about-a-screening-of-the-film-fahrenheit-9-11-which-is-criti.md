##### Fahrenheit 9/11
# Newly released cables from July 2004 reveal that American diplomats panicked about a screening of the film "Fahrenheit 9-11", which is critical of the U.S. government's response to the September 11 attacks. Diplomats stopped what they called a "potential fiasco" by intervening and contacting the offices of the New Zealand prime minister and Marian Hobbs, a government minister referred to as "Boo Boo" Hobbs by America. 

The US has been pressed by various government for help with wiretapping criminal and political adversaries, latest Wikileaks disclosures suggest.
