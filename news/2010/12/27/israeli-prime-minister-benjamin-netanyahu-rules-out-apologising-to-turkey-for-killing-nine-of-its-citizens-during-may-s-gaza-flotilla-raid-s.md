# Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rules out apologising to Turkey for killing nine of its citizens during May's Gaza flotilla raid,saying, however, that Israel would "express its regret"; the interview came after Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that Turkey should apologize to Israel for supporting terrorists. 

Israel&#8217;s prime minister said Israel will not apologize to Turkey for the interception of a Gaza-bound ship or the loss of life on board.
