# The death toll from recent violence between Christians and Muslims in Jos, Nigeria, rises to 80. Islamist group Boko Haram claims responsibility for the deadly Christmas Eve bombings in the city. 

A radical Islamist sect said on Tuesday it was behind bombings in central Nigeria and attacks on churches in the northeast of the country that led to the deaths of at least 86 people.
