##### South Korea
# Hundreds of South Korean troops, tanks, helicopters and jet fighters gather 12 miles from the border with North Korea to stage one of South Korea's largest ever live fire military drills in a "show of force" before its neighbour. North Korea describes the exercises as "warmongering", and threatens a "sacred war". 

South Korea stages one of its largest ever military drills, as its president warns of immediate retaliation to any attack by the North.
