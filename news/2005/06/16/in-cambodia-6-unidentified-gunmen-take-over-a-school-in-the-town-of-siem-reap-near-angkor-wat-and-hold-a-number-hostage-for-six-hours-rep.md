#  In Cambodia, 6 unidentified gunmen take over a school in the town of Siem Reap near Angkor Wat and hold a number hostage for six hours. Reports of the number of hostages range from 24 to 70. Many of them were children from foreign families that work in the area. Gunmen demand money, weapons and a car. A Canadian child is executed by the gunmen before the rest are freed. 

A hostage-taking of dozens of children at an international school in Cambodia has ended with a two-year-old Canadian boy dead
