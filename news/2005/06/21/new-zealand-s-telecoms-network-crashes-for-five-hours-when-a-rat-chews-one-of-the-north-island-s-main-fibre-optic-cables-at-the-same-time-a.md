#  New Zealand's telecoms network crashes for five hours when a rat chews one of the North Island's main fibre-optic cables at the same time as a workman damaged another cable in another part of the island. Mobile phone and Internet communications were badly affected, and the Stock Exchange had to close for several hours.

The general scientific community has already been using 1950 as the year "Before Present", when nuclear weapons began to significantly affect the reliability of radiocarbon dating of objects whose organic matter content formed after that epoch. ](/news/2018/02/19/in-a-scientific-reports-publication-researchers-propose-1965-as-the-start-of-the-anthropocene-era-in-that-year-human-nuclear-weapons-te.md) _Context: New Zealand_
