#  In Lebanon, Hezbollah and Amal parties claim victory in the parliamentary election in the south of the country. Both groups are supporters of Syria 

Two of Lebanon&#39;s pro-Syrian parties, Hizbullah, and Amal, claimed victory in South Lebanon in the first parliamentary elections free of Syrian control in three decades last night. Unofficial results showed the pair had, as widely expected, made a clean sweep of the 23 parliamentary seats up for grabs in the border area next to Israel.
