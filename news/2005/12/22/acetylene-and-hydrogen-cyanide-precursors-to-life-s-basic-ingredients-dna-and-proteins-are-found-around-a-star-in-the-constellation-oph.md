##### Acetylene
#  Acetylene and hydrogen cyanide, precursors to life's basic ingredients (DNA and proteins), are found around a star in the constellation Ophiuchus. 

Space.com: Astronomers find some of the basic compounds necessary to build organic molecules and proteins found in DNA within the inner regions of a planet-forming disk.
