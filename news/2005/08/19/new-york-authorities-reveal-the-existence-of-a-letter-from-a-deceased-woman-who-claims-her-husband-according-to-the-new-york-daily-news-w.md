##### New York City
#  New York authorities reveal the existence of a letter from a deceased woman who claims her husband (according to the New York Daily News, WINS 1010 cites a cab driver named Frank Burn) and two others killed Judge Joseph F. Crater and buried him under the boardwalk at Coney Island. Crater has been missing since 1930 and has since become one of the most famous "missing person" stories. 

Are New York cops about to find &#8220;the most missingest man in America?&#8221; Yes, if Friday reports in Big Apple newspapers prove true.
