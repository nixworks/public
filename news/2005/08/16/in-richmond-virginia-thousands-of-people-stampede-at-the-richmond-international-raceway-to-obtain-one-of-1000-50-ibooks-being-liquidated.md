#  In Richmond, Virginia, thousands of people stampede at the Richmond International Raceway to obtain one of 1000 $50 iBooks being liquidated by the Henrico County school district. Seventeen people suffer minor injuries, with four requiring hospital treatment. 

A rush to purchase $50 used laptops turned into a violent stampede Tuesday, with people getting thrown to the pavement, beaten with a folding chair and nearly driven over.
