##### Pope Benedict XVI
#  Pope Benedict XVI made his first foreign trip to his homeland Germany, attending the World Youth Day 2005. He was welcomed with cheers and made several speeches to leaders of Germany and to pilgrims at the Rhine banks at a ship as well as in front of the Cologne cathedrale. - 

Pope Benedict XVI returns home this week -- and Germany is warmly embracing its most famous son even as his mission of revitalizing the Roman Catholic Church faces an uncertain fate. &#160;NBC News Andy Eckardt reports from Cologne.
