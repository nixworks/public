#  In Lebanon, prime minister Fouad Siniora announces his new cabinet after long negotiations. Cabinet members include representative of Hezbollah when Christian leader Michel Aoun refuses to join 

After three weeks of political squabbling over key posts Lebanon&#39;s Prime Minister Fouad Siniora formed the new government which excludes Free Patriotic Movement leader Michel Aoun but includes for&nbsp; the first time a senior member of Hizbullah. The inclusion of Hizbullah drew an immediate rebuke from the U.S. officials.
