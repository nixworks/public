##### Denomination
#  Following a public statement from the denomination president on the eve of the event, the Congregationalist United Church of Christ begins their 5-day General Synod 25 in Atlanta, Georgia to debate a number of controversial resolutions, including same-sex marriage. Some are concerned about denominational schism. 

The United Church of Christ - famous for setting precedent - considers backing same-sex marriage at its national synod.
