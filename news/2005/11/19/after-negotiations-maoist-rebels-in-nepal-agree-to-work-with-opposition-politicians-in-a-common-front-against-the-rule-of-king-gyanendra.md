#  After negotiations, Maoist rebels in Nepal agree to work with opposition politicians in a common front against the rule of King Gyanendra. The Nepalese Civil War has killed more than 12,000 people since 1996. 

During the &quot;secret&quot; parleys with the alliance leaders in New Delhi, the rebels also indicated that they would extend the ceasefire period by a month.
