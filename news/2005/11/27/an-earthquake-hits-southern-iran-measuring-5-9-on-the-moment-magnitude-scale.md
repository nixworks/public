Although it was felt as far as Sicily, south Italy, Egypt, and Amman in Jordan, it was not disastrous due to its deep hypocentre and the sea-bed epicentre. Little damage (mainly in Kythira) and few light injuries are reported. ](/news/2006/01/8/a-strong-earthquake-measuring-6-7-on-the-moment-magnitude-scale-hits-greece-at-13-34-the-earthquake-s-epicentre-was-in-the-sea-region-25-n.md) _Context: M<sub>w</sub>&nbsp;5.2_
