##### Saad Hariri
#  Preliminary results indicate that political alliance of Saad Hariri, son of killed Rafiq Hariri, wins in Beirut parliamentary elections, despite of the low turnout 

Lebanon&#39;s Saad Hariri, the son of the country&#39;s assassinated former Premier, made a clean sweep in the first stage of the country&#39;s elections according to preliminary results. But the start of Lebanon&#39;s first free elections in more than 30 years was marred by a very low voter turnout of just 28 percent.
