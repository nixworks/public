##### Michel Aoun
#  Exiled Christian army general Michel Aoun returns to Lebanon from France. His supporters in the Free Patriotic Movement call for his election as a new president. 

Women ululated, men wept and youths hugged when Lebanon&#39;s anti-Syria politician appeared behind bullet-proof glass on Saturday to address tens of thousands of screaming supporters welcoming him back after more than a decade of exile.
