#  In Guinea, president Lansana Cont sacks three senior ministers, security minister Moussa Sampil, foreign affairs minister Mamadi Cond and mines minister Alpha Mady Soumah, to replace them with the members of his own Party of Unity and Progress. Journalists and students welcome sacking of Sampil because of his handling of an alleged assassination attempt against the president in January.
