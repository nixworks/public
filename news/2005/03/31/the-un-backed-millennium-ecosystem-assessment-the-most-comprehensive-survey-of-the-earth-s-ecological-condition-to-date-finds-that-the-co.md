#  The UN-backed Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the most comprehensive survey of the Earth's ecological condition to date, finds that the condition of the world's ecosystems is deteriorating at a dangerous rate. There has been "substantial and largely irreversible" loss of biodiversity, the report says. Basic resources like timber, water, and food are at risk in some areas, and may be put at risk in more.
