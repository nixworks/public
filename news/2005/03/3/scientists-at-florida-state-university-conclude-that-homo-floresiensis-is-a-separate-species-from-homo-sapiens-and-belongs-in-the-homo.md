#  Scientists at Florida State University conclude that "Homo floresiensis" is a separate species from "Homo sapiens" and belongs in the "Homo" genus through computer mapping of its brain. 

From newly charted astronomical anomalies at the far reaches of the universe to the rise of nanotechnology, nobody covers science and the latest discoveries like Reuters.com.
