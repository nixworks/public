##### Rafik Hariri
#  Following week-long public protests (in the wake of Rafik Hariri's assassination) and a no confidence vote, the entire government of Lebanon resigns. 

The president of Lebanon reappointed Omar Karami as the country&#39;s prime minister on Thursday, 10 days after the staunchly pro-Syrian Karami stepped down amid street protests and international pressure.
