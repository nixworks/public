#  In Tunisia, authorities continue to clean up an oil spill near the town of Korbous that was caused by a Moroccan container ship running aground late the day before. 

Clean-up operations resumed Thursday on the Tunisian coast after a Moroccan container ship leaked tons of oil from its fuel tanks when it ran aground in stormy seas. Seven Dutch experts were due at the scene to help plug the leaks to prevent nearly 200 tons of heavy oil and dies-el escaping.&lt;BR>
