##### Arecibo radio telescope
#  New observations from the Arecibo radio telescope confirm that asteroid 2004 MN 4 (later named 99942 Apophis in July 2005), once briefly considered an impact risk, will pass Earth on April 13 2029 at a distance of 36,350 km (22,600 mi) and will reach magnitude 3.3, easily visible to the naked eye from Europe, Africa and western Asia. 

An asteroid expected to fly past Earth in 2029 inside the orbits of some satellite will be visible without telescopes.
