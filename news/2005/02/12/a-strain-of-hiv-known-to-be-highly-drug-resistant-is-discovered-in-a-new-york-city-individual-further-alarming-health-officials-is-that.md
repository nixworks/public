##### Strain
#  A strain of HIV, known to be highly drug-resistant, is discovered in a New York City individual. Further alarming health officials is that the onset of AIDS began within a few months of his diagnosis, a process which ordinarily takes over ten years. The patient is known to have frequently taken methamphetamine, a mutagen.
