##### Association of University Teachers
#  The Association of University Teachers, the leading British academic group, has voted to boycott two Israeli universities, Haifa University and Bar-Ilan University, over their alleged involvement in "illegal activity" in the occupied territories. The AUT said it voted for the boycott in response to a plea for action by a group of Palestinian academics. It was condemned by the Israeli Embassy, the British Ambassador in Israel, by Jewish Human Rights groups and by Universities UK.
