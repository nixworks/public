##### College of American Pathologists
#  The College of American Pathologists asks laboratories worldwide to destroy a flu sample they sent in their testing kits. The Canadian National Microbial Laboratory identified it as a strain of Asian flu virus that killed millions in 1957. People born after 1969 would have no antibodies to resist it. The World Health Organization supports the plea.
