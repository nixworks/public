##### Anheuser-Busch
#  Anheuser-Busch, the largest U.S. beer brewer and the No. 1 buyer of rice in the United States said it would not purchase rice grown in Missouri if it were genetically modified. This decision was prompted by a Ventria Bioscience plan to grow 200 acres (800,000 m) of genetically engineered rice in Missouri.
