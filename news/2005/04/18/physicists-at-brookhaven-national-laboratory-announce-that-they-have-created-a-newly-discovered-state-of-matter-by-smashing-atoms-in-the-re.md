##### Brookhaven National Laboratory
#  Physicists at Brookhaven National Laboratory announce that they have created a newly discovered state of matter by smashing atoms in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. This new state of matter behaves like a hot and dense liquid made up of basic atomic particles such as quarks and gluons. Researchers claim that all matter in the universe for a fraction of a second after the Big Bang was in the form of this liquid.
