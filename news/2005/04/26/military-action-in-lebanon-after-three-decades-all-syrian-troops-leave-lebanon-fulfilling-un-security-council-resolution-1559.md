##### Military action in Lebanon
#  Military action in Lebanon: After three decades, all Syrian troops leave Lebanon, fulfilling UN Security Council Resolution 1559. 

Today, as the last Syrian troops depart from the country they have occupied for 29 years, the Lebanese will likely breathe a sigh of relief. But they won&#39;t have much time to savor the sweetness of their newfound liberty; they are now left with the task of managing their own affairs, and there is an awful lot of work to be done.
