##### Civil Unions and Relationships Acts
#  The Civil Unions and Relationships Acts take effect in New Zealand. These laws allow same-sex and de facto couples to form legal unions that are similar to marriage. 

The first couples have applied to have their relationships recognised by a civil union after a change in the law came into effect today. - New Zealand Herald
