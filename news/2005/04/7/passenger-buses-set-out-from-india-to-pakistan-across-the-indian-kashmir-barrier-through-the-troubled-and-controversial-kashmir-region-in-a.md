#  Passenger buses set out from India to Pakistan across the Indian Kashmir barrier through the troubled and controversial Kashmir region in a symbolic "Caravan of Peace." Some attacks on the buses were reported in the militant-occupied area, but none were successful, according to local media outlets. 

Buses departed Thursday from both the Indian and Pakistani sides of divided Kashmir with a few dozen passengers aboard, heading across one of the world&#8217;s most heavily militarized frontiers in a symbolic step toward peace in a region riven by violence.
