# Police in China arrest more than 900 people as they shutdown a million dollar crime ring that was selling rat meat as mutton. 

Chinese police have broken a crime ring that passed off more than $1 million in rat and small mammal meat as mutton, authorities said, in a food safety crackdown that coincides with a bird flu outbreak and other environmental pressures.
