# In a study by SUNY Buffalo, it is discovered that "Utricularia gibba", a carnivorous bladderwort plant, has the shortest known DNA sequence of any multicellular plant and that it lacks "junk DNA", sequences of code that do not encode proteins. 

How much of your DNA is constructive? Of the 3 billion letters that make up your genome, only 1.5 percent consists of genes-DNA actually does something useful, which carry the information for protein synthesis. Of the remaining 98.5 percent-the vast majority of the genetic material known as noncoding DNA that does not code for proteins, is not needed for a healthy organism, according to new research.
