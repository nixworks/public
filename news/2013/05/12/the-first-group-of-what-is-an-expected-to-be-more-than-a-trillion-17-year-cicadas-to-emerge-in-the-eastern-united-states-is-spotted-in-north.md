##### 17-year cicada
# The first group of what is an expected to be more than a trillion 17-year cicadas to emerge in the eastern United States is spotted in North Carolina. 

The &#034;Swarmagaddon,&#034;-a cicada invasion as many people call, that is expected to engulf much of the United States&#039; Atlantic seaboard over the next few weeks touched off this week in North Carolina. Its bugs number in the billions and will outnumber humans in the affected areas by ratios as high as 600 to 1.
