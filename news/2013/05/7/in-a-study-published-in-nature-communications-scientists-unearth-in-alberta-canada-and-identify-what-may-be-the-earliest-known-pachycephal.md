# In a study published in Nature Communications, scientists unearth in Alberta, Canada and identify what may be the earliest known pachycephalosaur (bone-headed dinosaur), "Acrotholus audeti". 

We can add another dinosaur species to the roster, with a newly identified type of bone-headed creature discovered in Alberta, Canada. It&#039;s especially significant considering scientists believe it may be the oldest bonehead dinosaur to be found in North America, and maybe even the world.
