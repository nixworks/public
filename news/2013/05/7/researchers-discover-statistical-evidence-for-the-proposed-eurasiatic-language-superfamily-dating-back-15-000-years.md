# Researchers discover statistical evidence for the proposed Eurasiatic language superfamily, dating back 15,000 years. 

Would Ice Age man understand us? It depends on the words we use. Digging through the worlds&apos; many languages for &apos;fossil&apos; words that have escaped significant erosion over time, researchers have discovered a superfamily that existed as far back as 15,000 years ago, near the end of the Ice Age. This superfamily, described in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, may have given rise to several different language groups ¿ including Indo-European, which boasts roughly 3 billion speakers and contains such disparate languages as Spanish and Hindi. The researchers first had to find cognates across the languages ¿ words that come from a common original source and maintain the same meaning and similar sound, or have undergone predictable changes.
