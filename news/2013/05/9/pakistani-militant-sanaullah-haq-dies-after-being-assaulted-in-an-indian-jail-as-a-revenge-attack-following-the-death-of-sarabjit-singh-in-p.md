# Pakistani militant Sanaullah Haq dies after being assaulted in an Indian jail as a revenge attack following the death of Sarabjit Singh in Pakistan last week. 

A convicted Pakistani militant jailed in India died on Thursday in hospital after being beaten by another inmate in an apparent revenge attack for the death of an Indian spy prisoner, threatening already fraught relations between the two nations.
