# Drone attacks in Pakistan: Pakistani intelligence officials claim that a US drone attack has killed 5 alleged foreign militants, including Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan commander Wali-ur-Rehman, in the North Waziristan town of Miran Shah. 

A suspected American strike early Wednesday killed Wali ur-Rehman, the deputy leader, two Pakistani officials said, dealing a potentially serious blow to the insurgency.
