# Convicted Indian spy Sarabjit Singh dies after being attacked by fellow inmates in a Pakistani prison. He is flown home to India where the government of Punjab has declared him a martyr. 

A special aircraft carrying the body of Sarabjit Singh, the Indian prisoner who died at a Lahore hospital today, landed in Amritsar shortly after 7:30 pm tonight. The lack of basic paperwork had delayed the plane&#039;s take-off from Lahore airport by over two hours. India is extremely upset about the delay.
