# A stolen dinosaur skeleton is returned to Mongolia. 

It&apos;s bad enough to go from roaming the earth as a fearsome predator to being uprooted and dragged across three continents, but to end up in a basement in Queens? No wonder the Tyrannosaurus Bataar was broken up. Literally. But not for long. Prosecutors and customs officials Monday loaded up boxes containing chunks of the 70-million-year-old dinosaur to ship him home to Mongolia, ending an odyssey driven by greedy fossil hunters whose attempt to sell the skeleton led to their downfall and Tyrannosaurus Bataar&apos;s resurrection.
