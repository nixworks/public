##### Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb
# Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb commander Mokhtar Belmokhtar claims responsibility for two suicide bombing attacks that killed 30 people in Niger on May 23. 

If true, Mokhtar Belmokhtar’s claim would put one of the Sahel’s most hardened militants, whom Chad’s military said it had killed, back at the center of jihad.
