# A Palestinian sniper kills a Bedouin laborer who was repairing the Israeli fence surrounding Gaza; following this, the Israeli Military attacked targets in Gaza with airstrikes and ground forces, killing at least one Palestinian three-year-old child and wounding several others.

The deaths of an Israeli laborer and a Palestinian toddler were the latest in a growing wave of Israeli-Palestinian violence.
