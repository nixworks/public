##### President of Russia
# Russian President Vladimir Putin broke with a long tradition of Soviet and Russian heads of state and delivered two New Year's speeches instead of one. The second New Year's address was made from Khabarovsk, a far-eastern city hit by devastating floods in summer, instead of the Moscow Kremlin. 

Russia&rsquo;s president travels seven time zones away to change the subject from fear to optimism.
