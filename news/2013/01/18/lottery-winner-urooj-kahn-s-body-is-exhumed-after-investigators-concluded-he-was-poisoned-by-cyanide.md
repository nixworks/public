# Lottery winner Urooj Kahn's body is exhumed after investigators concluded he was poisoned by cyanide. 

Several helicopters hovered over Rosehill Cemetery on Chicago&apos;s North Side this morning as police prepared to exhume the body of Urooj Khan, a West Rogers Park man who died of cyanide poisoning last summer after winning a million-dollar lottery.
