# The finance ministers of the European Union are ready to give their needed approval to those countries within the EU that want to establish a Tobin tax, that is, a tax in financial transactions. 

Germany, France and nine other euro zone countries will get the go-ahead on Tuesday to start work on a financial transactions tax, a measure likely to unsettle banks and trading houses but which will please voters and could raise much-needed revenue.
