# NASA announces new data effectively rules out a 2036 Earth impact for the near-Earth asteroid 99942 Apophis. 

NASA scientists at the agency&#039;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., effectively have ruled out the possibility the asteroid Aphophis will impact Earth during a close flyby in 2036.
