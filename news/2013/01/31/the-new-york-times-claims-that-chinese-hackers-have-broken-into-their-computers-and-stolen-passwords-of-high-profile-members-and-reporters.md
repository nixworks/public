# "The New York Times" claims that Chinese hackers have broken into their computers and stolen passwords of high-profile members and reporters over the past four months, around the same time the paper began an investigation involving wealth accumulation by relatives of Premier Wen Jiabao. 

The timing of the attacks coincided with reporting for an investigation that found that the relatives of Chinaâ€™s prime minister had accumulated a fortune worth several billion dollars through business dealings.
