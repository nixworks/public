# Icelandic teenager Blaer Bjarkardottir wins a legal fight to use the name given to her by her mother, which the Icelandic Naming Committee had argued was not a proper female given name. 

A 15-year-old Icelandic girl has won the right to use the name her mother gave her, after she took authorities to court over it.
