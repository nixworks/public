# Six Russian tourists are killed and two tourists are seriously injured after a snowmobile towing a sled veers off a ski slope, crashes into a barrier, and flies into a ditch on Italy's Mount Cermis. 

Six Russian tourists die as their snowmobile flips over during a night-time run down an Alpine ski slope in north-eastern Italy, reports say.
