# Irish politicians respond to High Court Judge Paul Carney's order that a man who plead guilty in court to repeatedly raping his daughter as a child be granted bail and provisional released. Taoiseach Enda Kenny comments on a nation "filled with revulsion" at the outcome of the case, while opposition politician Gerry Adams refers to abuse his father inflicted on others. 

The prime minister of the Irish Republic says he hopes other rape victims will not be discouraged from coming forward in the wake of the controversial outcome of a rape case.
