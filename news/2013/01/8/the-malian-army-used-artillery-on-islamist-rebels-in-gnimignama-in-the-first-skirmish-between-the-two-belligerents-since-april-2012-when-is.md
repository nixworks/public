# The Malian army used artillery on Islamist rebels in Gnimignama in the first skirmish between the two belligerents since April 2012, when Islamist and Tuareg rebels first assumed control of the region. 

Malian soldiers fire warning shots as Islamist fighters advance south from their northern strongholds, military sources say.
