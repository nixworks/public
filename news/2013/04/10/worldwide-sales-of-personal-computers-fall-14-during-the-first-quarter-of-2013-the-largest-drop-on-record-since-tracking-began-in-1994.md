##### Worldwide sales
# Worldwide sales of personal computers fall 14% during the first quarter of 2013, the largest drop on record since tracking began in 1994. 

PC sales during the first quarter were the lowest since IDC began keeping track. Mostly to blame, said the research firm, was Microsoft&#039;s Windows 8.
