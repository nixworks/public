# In Lebanon, President Michel Suleiman asks Tammam Salam, a legislator and a former minister of culture, to head a new cabinet after a vast majority of the members of Parliament chose him for the job. 

Tammam Salam was officially named the new prime minister of Lebanon on Saturday after receiving a string of endorsements from the countryâ€™s warring factions over the past few days.
