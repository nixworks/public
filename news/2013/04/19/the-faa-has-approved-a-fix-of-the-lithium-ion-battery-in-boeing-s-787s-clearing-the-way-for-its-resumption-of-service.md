# The FAA has approved a fix of the lithium-ion battery in Boeing's 787s, clearing the way for its resumption of service. 

Boeing Co. won U.S. approval for the 787 Dreamliner’s redesigned battery, setting the stage for ANA Holdings Inc. and Japan Airlines Co., the jet’s two biggest operators, to seek domestic clearance to restart flights.
