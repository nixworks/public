# The Boston Police Department chases two carjacking suspects in the MIT shooting death of a campus policeman to the nearby suburb of Watertown where, after a gunfight that included explosives, an MBTA officer is injured, one suspect is dead, and the other flees but is later captured. 

Four months ago, the Boston bombing suspect, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed yesterday in a shootout with police, uploaded to his YouTube Channel an eight-minute lecture by the radical Australian Muslim preacher Sheikh Feiz Mohammed denouncing the Harry Potter movies for glorifying and promoting paganism.
