##### Pollution in China
# According to a new study, more than one million people per year die prematurely due to the air pollution in China. 

About 1.2 million people die prematurely every year in China from exposure to outdoor air pollution. Smog has dogged the country as it grows at an explosive rate and burns huge quantities of fossil fuels. But there are signs that the government is beginning to take the issue more seriously.
