# North Korea renews a threat to permanently close its Kaesong joint industrial zone with South Korea, blaming the "confrontation" policies of the South Korea's new president, Park Geun-hye. 

A powerful US military sea-based radar is now in place to detect any possible missile launches by North Korea, according to a senior US defence official.
