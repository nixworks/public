# India's Supreme Court rejects a plea by Novartis to patent an updated version of its cancer drug, Glivec (Imatinib), amid concerns that a patent could threaten access to cheap generic versions of drugs in poorer countries. 

Production of cheap copycat drugs for H.I.V. and cancer used by people in developing countries in Africa and Asia was ensured on Monday in a ruling by Indiaâ€™s Supreme Court.
