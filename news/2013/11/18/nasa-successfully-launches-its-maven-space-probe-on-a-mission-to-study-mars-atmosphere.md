The aircraft, officially named Quiet Supersonic Transport (QueSST) and dubbed the "Son of Concorde", was proposed by NASA and has just been given the go-ahead by US officials. QueSST could make its maiden voyage in 2021 if all goes according to plan. If so, it will halve the current travel time between London and New York. ](/news/2018/02/13/a-new-plane-that-would-fly-from-london-to-new-york-in-three-hours-has-just-received-crucial-funding-the-aircraft-officially-named-quiet-su.md) _Context: NASA_
