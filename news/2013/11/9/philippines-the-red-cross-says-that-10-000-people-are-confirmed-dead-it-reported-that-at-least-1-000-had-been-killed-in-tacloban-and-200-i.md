# Philippines: The Red Cross says that 10,000 people are confirmed dead. It reported that at least 1,000 had been killed in Tacloban and 200 in Samar province. 

The Red Cross says that more than 1,200 people are confirmed dead as Haiyan, one of the most powerful-ever tropical typhoons, blows through the Philippines. Local authorities earlier put the death toll at nearer 100.
