# The United States commemorates the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address. 

When president Abraham Lincoln dedicated a cemetery on the Gettysburg battlefield 150 years ago on Tuesday, the US had already been at war with itself for almost three years. The nation would fight on for another 18 months, and by then almost a million people would be dead or wounded.
