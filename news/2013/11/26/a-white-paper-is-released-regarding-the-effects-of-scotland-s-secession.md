##### White Paper
# A White Paper is released regarding the effects of Scotland's secession. 

First Minister Alex Salmond says &#034;it would cost the UK &pound;500m&#034; not to have an independent Scotland in the sterling currency, and would leave a &#034;massive hole in the UK balance of payments&#034;
