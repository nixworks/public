# A Mexican federal court overturns a state court ruling that allowed the drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero to be released from prison earlier this year. This court response follows a decision by the U.S. Department of State to place a $5 million bounty against him. 

Rafael Caro Quintero was 28 years into a 40-year sentence for helping orchestrate the killing of a DEA agent when he was released in August.
