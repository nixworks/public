# Panamanian authorities seize North Korean bulk carrier "Chong Chon Gang" after a missile is found on board. The captain of the ship, which was en route from Cuba, attempted to commit suicide.

Panama seizes a North Korean-flagged ship carrying &quot;undeclared military cargo&quot; suspected to be &quot;sophisticated missile equipment&quot;, its president says.
