# In the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, 126 mm of rain falls causing major flooding bursting most rivers and creeks. It is the single highest rain total in a day since Hurricane Hazel. 

A Toronto police marine unit rescues some 1,400 people from a commuter train that had become stranded on tracks &mdash; with water up to the windows &mdash; after a record rainfall pounded the city and slowed the evening commute.
