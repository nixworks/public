# Researchers from different medical centers at major cities in the United Kingdom, led by Cancer Research UK's London Research Institute and University College London, are embarking on a massive long-term effort to study lung cancer's resistance to treatment by mapping involved genes using patient profiles. 

Scientists across Britain are to map the genes of the tumours of 850 lung cancer patients in a bid to understand more about the deadly disease.
