# The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 close at record highs, with the NASDAQ hitting its highest level in ten years. 

U.S. stocks inched only slightly higher Friday, but the slim gains were enough to put the Dow and S&P 500 at new record closing highs and the Nasdaq at the highest level since in over a decade. Boeing shares sank almost 5%.
