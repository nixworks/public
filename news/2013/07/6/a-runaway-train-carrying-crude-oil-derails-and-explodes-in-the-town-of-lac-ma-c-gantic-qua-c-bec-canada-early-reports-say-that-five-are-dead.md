##### Derails and explodes
# A runaway train carrying crude oil derails and explodes in the town of Lac-Megantic, Quebec, Canada. Early reports say that five are dead, a hundred are missing and 2000 are evacuated. 

The train that careened into the centre of town early Saturday was unmanned when it derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a spokesperson for the company that owns the locomotive.
