##### Mariana Trench
# New data suggests that the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the World Ocean, is home to a large amount of bacterial life forms. 

Microbes have been found surprisingly thriving in the deepest spot on Earth, the Mariana Trench, suggesting other trenches could also be hotspots for life.
