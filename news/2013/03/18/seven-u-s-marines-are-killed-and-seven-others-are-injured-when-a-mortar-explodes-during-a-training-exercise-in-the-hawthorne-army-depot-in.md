# Seven U.S. Marines are killed and seven others are injured when a mortar explodes during a training exercise in the Hawthorne Army Depot in Hawthorne, Nevada, United States. 

A deadly explosion at a military ammunition storage facility in Nevada during a training exercise Monday prompted the U.S. Marine Corps to issue a blanket suspension of 60-millimeter mortars and associated tubes pending a review of the accident.
