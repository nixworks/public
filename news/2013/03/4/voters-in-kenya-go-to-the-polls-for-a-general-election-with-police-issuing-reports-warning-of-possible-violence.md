# Voters in Kenya go to the polls for a general election with police issuing reports warning of possible violence. 

At least four Kenyan police officers, deployed to keep the peace in a tense presidential election following hundreds of deaths after a 2007 vote, were hacked to death by a gang hours before polling stations opened on Monday, a senior officer said.
