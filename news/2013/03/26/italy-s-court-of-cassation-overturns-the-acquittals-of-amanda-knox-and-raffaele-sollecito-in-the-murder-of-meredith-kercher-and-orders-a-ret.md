# Italy's Court of Cassation overturns the acquittals of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito in the murder of Meredith Kercher and orders a retrial. However, Knox, who returned home immediately upon release, is not expected to be there as the U.S. tends not to extradite its citizens to face legal action. 

Amanda Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were acquitted on appeal in 2011 for the killing of Meredith Kercher &#8211; but now face a retrial.
