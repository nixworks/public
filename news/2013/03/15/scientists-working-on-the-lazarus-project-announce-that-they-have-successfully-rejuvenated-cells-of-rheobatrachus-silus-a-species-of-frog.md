##### Rheobatrachus silus
# Scientists working on the Lazarus Project announce that they have successfully rejuvenated cells of "Rheobatrachus silus", a species of frog extinct since 1983. 

The Lazarus Project team says they have been able to recover cell nuclei of the extinct gastric-brooding frog, Rheobatrachus silus, from tissues collected in the 1970s and kept for 40 years in a conventional deep freezer. The genome of Rheobatrachus silus, extinct since 1983, has been revived and reactivated by a team of scientists using soma
