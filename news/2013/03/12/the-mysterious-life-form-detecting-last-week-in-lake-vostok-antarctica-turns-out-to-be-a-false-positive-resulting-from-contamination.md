# The "mysterious life form" detecting last week in Lake Vostok, Antarctica, turns out to be a false positive resulting from contamination. 

Last week, Russian scientists announced the discovery of a new type of bacterial life found in the water samples collected from the ancient Lake Vostok, but on 11 March the lab confirmed that it was not the bacteria but the contamination that generated the signal.
