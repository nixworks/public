##### Dow Jones Industrial Average
# The Dow Jones Industrial Average surpasses pre-financial crisis levels, reaching an all-time high, last set in October 2007, after the release of better than expected economic data from the United States and Europe and the Chinese growth target. 

There are concerns about whether the forces that have driven the market rally — government spending and banner corporate profits — will be sufficient to push it higher.
