# The Indian rupee hits new record low against the US dollar. The rupee fell to 62.85 rupees against the dollar. 

The rupee hit a record low on Monday as defence of the currency failed to stop its decline but exacted a rising toll, with bond yields surging to five-year highs and investors demanding higher returns in an auction of cash bills.
