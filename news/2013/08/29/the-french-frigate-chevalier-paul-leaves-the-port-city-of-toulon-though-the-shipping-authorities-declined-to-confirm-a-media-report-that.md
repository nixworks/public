# The French frigate "Chevalier Paul" leaves the port city of Toulon, though the shipping authorities declined to confirm a media report that it was headed to Syria. 

MPs vote against possible military action against Syria, ruling out involvement in US-led attacks, while France says the vote does not change its resolve to act.
