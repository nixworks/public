QueSST could make its maiden voyage in 2021 if all goes according to plan. If so, it will halve the current travel time between London and New York. ](/news/2018/02/13/a-new-plane-that-would-fly-from-london-to-new-york-in-three-hours-has-just-received-crucial-funding-the-aircraft-officially-named-quiet-su.md) _Context: NASA_
