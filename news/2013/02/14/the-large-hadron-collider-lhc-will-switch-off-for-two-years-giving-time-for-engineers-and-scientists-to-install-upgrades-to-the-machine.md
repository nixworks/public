##### Large Hadron Collider
# The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will switch off for two years, giving time for engineers and scientists to install upgrades to the machine. 

The Large Hadron Collider shuts down for a two-year-long period of maintenance and upgrades that should see a near-doubling of its collision energies.
