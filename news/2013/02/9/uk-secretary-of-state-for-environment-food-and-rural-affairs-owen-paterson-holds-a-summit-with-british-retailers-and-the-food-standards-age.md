# UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Owen Paterson holds a summit with British retailers and the Food Standards Agency to ask how "beef" products containing horse meat were sold in supermarkets. 

Retailers will now carry out &quot;more and tougher testing&quot; of beef products in the wake of widespread horsemeat contamination, the environment secretary says.
