##### Fishing vessel
# A fishing vessel capsizes off of Liverpool, Nova Scotia, Canada, leaving 5 fishermen missing in the frigid waters. 

A massive search was set to continue through Monday night off Liverpool for five fishermen who were aboard a boat that reportedly capsized late Sunday. An emergency beacon was set off just after 11 p.m., after the 14-metre vessel named the Miss Ally went down in heavy seas and near hurricane-force winds.
