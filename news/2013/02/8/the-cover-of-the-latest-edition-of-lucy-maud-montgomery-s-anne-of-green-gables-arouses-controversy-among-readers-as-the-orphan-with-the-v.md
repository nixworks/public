##### Lucy Maud Montgomery
# The cover of the latest edition of Lucy Maud Montgomery's "Anne of Green Gables" arouses controversy among readers as the orphan with the "very thick, decidedly red hair" and the "much freckled" face is transformed into a blonde, buxom farm girl with come-hither eyes. This follows the recent controversy over a new cover for Sylvia Plath's "The Bell Jar" which portrays a young woman applying make-up.
