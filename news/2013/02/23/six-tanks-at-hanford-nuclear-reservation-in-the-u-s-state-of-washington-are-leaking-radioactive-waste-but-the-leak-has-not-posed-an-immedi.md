##### Hanford Nuclear Reservation
# Six tanks at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in the U.S. state of Washington are leaking radioactive waste, but the leak has not posed an immediate public health risk. 

Six underground tanks holding a mix of radioactive and toxic waste are leaking at Americaâ€™s most contaminated nuclear site in Washington, federal and state officials say, posing an eventual risk to groundwater and rivers.
