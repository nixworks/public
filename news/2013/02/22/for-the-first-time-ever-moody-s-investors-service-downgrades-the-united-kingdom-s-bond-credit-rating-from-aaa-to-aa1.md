##### Moody's Investors Service
# For the first time ever, Moody's Investors Service downgrades the United Kingdom's bond credit rating from AAA to AA1. 

The UK loses its top AAA credit rating for the first time since 1978, with Chancellor George Osborne saying it will not weaken his &quot;resolve&quot; on the deficit.
