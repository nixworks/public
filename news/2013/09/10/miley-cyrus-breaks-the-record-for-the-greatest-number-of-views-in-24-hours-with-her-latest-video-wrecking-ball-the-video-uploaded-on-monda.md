##### Miley Cyrus
# Miley Cyrus breaks the record for the greatest number of views in 24 hours with her latest video Wrecking Ball. The video, uploaded on Monday, has 19.3 million views after a single day, and many people complain about this video. This has been her second record, and the third Vevo record video to become a frequent target for negative comments, the others being Stupid Hoe by Nicki Minaj and We Can't Stop by Miley Cyrus, the latter record set earlier this year.
