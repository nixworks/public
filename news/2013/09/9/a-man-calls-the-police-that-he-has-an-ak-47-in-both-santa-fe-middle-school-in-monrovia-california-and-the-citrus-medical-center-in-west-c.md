# A man calls the police that he has an AK-47 in both Santa Fe Middle School in Monrovia, California and the "Citrus Medical Center" in West Covina, California. 

A Monrovia middle school was on lockdown Monday afternoon after a man called police and said he was on campus with a firearm, authorities said. A male caller phoned the Monrovia Police Department at about 2 p.m., saying he was on the campus of Santa Fe Middle School with an AK-47 assault rifle, Lt. Michael Lee said.
