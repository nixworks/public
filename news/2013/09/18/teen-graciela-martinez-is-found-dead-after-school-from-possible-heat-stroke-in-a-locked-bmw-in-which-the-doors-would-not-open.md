# Teen Graciela Martinez is found dead after school from possible heat stroke in a locked BMW in which the doors would not open. 

A 14-year-old girl who was found lifeless by her brother last week in their parked car at a high school in Madera may have died of heat stroke, authorities said Wednesday.
