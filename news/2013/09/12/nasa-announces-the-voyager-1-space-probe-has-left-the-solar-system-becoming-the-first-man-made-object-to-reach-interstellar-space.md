# NASA announces the Voyager 1 space probe has left the solar system becoming the first man-made object to reach interstellar space. 

After almost a year of debate, NASA has accepted the idea that its Voyager 1 probe has left behind the last wisps of the solar wind and is flying through interstellar space. But has it left the solar system? Um, not exactly.
