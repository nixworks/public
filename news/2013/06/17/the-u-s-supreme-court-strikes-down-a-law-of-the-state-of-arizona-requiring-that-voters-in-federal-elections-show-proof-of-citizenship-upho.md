##### Supreme Court of the United States
# The U.S. Supreme Court strikes down a law of the state of Arizona requiring that voters in federal elections show proof of citizenship, upholding the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. 

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday struck down an Arizona law that required people registering to vote in federal elections to show proof of citizenship, a victory for activists who said it had discouraged Native Americans and Latinos from voting.
