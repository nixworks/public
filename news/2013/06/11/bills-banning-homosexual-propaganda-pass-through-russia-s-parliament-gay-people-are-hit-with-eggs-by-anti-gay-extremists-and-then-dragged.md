# Bills banning homosexual "propaganda" pass through Russia's parliament; gay people are hit with eggs by anti-gay extremists and then dragged off by police near the Duma. 

Gay activists were attacked and then arrested outside Russia’s parliament as lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a bill that will ban “gay propaganda” aimed at under-18s. The Duma passed the bill, which outlaws the “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations”, by 436 votes to zero, with one abstention.
