##### Prime Minister of Canada
# The Prime Minister of Canada and the European Union tentatively sign a free trade and copyright agreement. 

Canada and the EU have sign a tentative deal to open up markets and drop nearly all import taxes, on everything from food to cars to intellectual property. Prime Minster Stephen Harper signed the agreement in principle in Brussels today, but it could be two years or more before it is in effect.
