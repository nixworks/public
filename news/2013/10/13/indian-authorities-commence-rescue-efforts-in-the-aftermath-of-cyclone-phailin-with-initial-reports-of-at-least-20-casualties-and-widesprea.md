# Indian authorities commence rescue efforts in the aftermath of Cyclone Phailin, with initial reports of at least 20 casualties and widespread damage along the landfall area. 

Heavy rain brought by cyclone Phailin on Sunday triggered floods in Odisha, forcing authorities to evacuate thousands of people after rain water entered their homes, officials said on Monday.
