##### Czech legislative election
# Results of the Czech legislative election are very fragmented, the big winner being the new centrist liberal ANO 2011 which gains 47 out of 200 seats. 

An election held to try to end months of political uncertainty in the Czech Republic fails to produce a clear winner.
