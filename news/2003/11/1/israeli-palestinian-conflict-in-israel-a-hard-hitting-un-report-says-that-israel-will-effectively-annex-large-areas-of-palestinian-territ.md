##### Israeli-Palestinian conflict
#  Israeli-Palestinian conflict: In Israel, a hard-hitting UN report says that Israel will effectively annex large areas of Palestinian territory as a result of the permits it intends to issue to Palestinians near the wall being built. The Israeli West Bank barrier has been built inside the internationally recognised Green Line about 18,000 acres (73&nbsp;km 2 ) and cuts off the rest of the West Bank. It has been declared a "closed military zone".
