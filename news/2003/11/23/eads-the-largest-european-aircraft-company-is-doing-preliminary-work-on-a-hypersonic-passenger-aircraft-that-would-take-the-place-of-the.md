##### EADS
#  EADS, the largest European aircraft company, is doing preliminary work on a hypersonic passenger aircraft that would take the place of the recently retired Concorde; the planning includes collaboration with Japanese firms and Ministry of International Trade and Industry. However, its subsidiary Airbus' A380 'super-jumbo' sub-sonic vehicle is the product expected to become the dominant commercial aircraft in the near-future.
