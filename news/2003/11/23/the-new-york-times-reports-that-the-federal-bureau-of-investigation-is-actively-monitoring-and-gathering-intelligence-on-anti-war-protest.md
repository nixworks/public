##### New York Times
#  The "New York Times" reports that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is actively monitoring and gathering intelligence on anti-war protest movements' activities, ostensibly to detect possible terrorist activity. Opponents such as the American Civil Liberties Union criticize the practice as regressionary to the days of J. Edgar Hoover's intense monitoring of private organizations for potential communist links.
