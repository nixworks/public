#  A BBC "Correspondent" programme, based on computer-generated images, suggests that the Warren Commission's controversial magic bullet theory, in which it was claimed that the same bullet hit President John F. Kennedy and Governor John Connally during Kennedy's assassination in 1963, was correct. Using state of the art computer generated images based on the Zapruder film, the programme concludes that a lone gunman could have shot Kennedy. ABC News and Court TV arrived at a similar conclusion
