##### Upper house
#  Germany's upper house rejects controversial economic policy changes (tax cuts and changes to labour law) aimed at kick-starting Europe's largest economy. Social Democrat Chancellor Gerhard Schrder has invested much political capital in the reforms, but they are opposed by many labour unions and left-wing politicians.
