##### Tikrit
#  Two US paratroopers are killed west of Baghdad. US forces bomb homes in Tikrit, following the shooting down of a helicopter. Iraqi and American rights investigators state to a conference they had identified 260 mass graves containing the bodies of at least 300,000 Iraqis murdered by Saddam's regime. Debate intensifies about the choices the U.S. faces in devising a strategy for Iraq. U.S. Senator John McCain argues that force levels are inadequate. The International Red Cross, which was already planning to reduce staff in Iraq following a deadly attack on its Baghdad headquarters, states it is temporarily closing its Baghdad and Basra offices due to dangerous conditions. A US Army study concludes that Iraqi intelligence was excellent during the conflict (in which their fighting forces collapsed), and probably still is. Much work is still needed to win over hearts-and-minds in Iraq.
