##### United Nations
#  The United Nations votes again and overwhelmingly in a non-binding and non-enforceable resolution for an end to sanctions against Cuba; only the US, Israel, and the Marshall Islands vote against. The US's United Nations ambassador John Negroponte avoided the forum. Washington responded to the vote through a mid-level diplomat, Sichan Siv, who tells the General Assembly delegates that the Cuban embargo was a "bilateral issue" which was really none of the UN's business.
