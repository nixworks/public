##### Enron Corporation
#  Enron announces proposed sale of Portland General Electric for $2.35 billion, including assumption of debt. The sale is to a newly formed LLC backed by a private investment firm from Texas. This happens after Portland-area residents defeated a ballot measure to take over the utility on November 4. PGE had outspent supporters of the takeover 60-to-1.
