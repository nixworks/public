##### Coca eradication
#  Coca eradication: The White House Drug Policy Office claims the area planted with coca in Peru and Bolivia combined fell by 35&nbsp;km 2 in the year up to June, suggesting that the coca eradication program in neighboring Colombia was not driving production over the borders. But the US figures were very different from preliminary estimates in September by the head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime in Colombia, which suggested output in Peru and Bolivia may have risen by as much 21 per cent that year.
