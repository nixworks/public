#  An array of senior figures in the United States criticize the case the Bush administration used to go to war with Iraq; they state that there never was a clear and present danger. Paul Bremer says that attacks on coalition forces in Iraq will get worse unless intelligence improves; he says several hundred terrorists have entered Iraq from neighbouring countries.
