##### Prince of Wales
#  In the United Kingdom, the Prince of Wales returns from a foreign trip to confront enormous media interest in rumours of homosexual acts involving him and a former aide arising from allegations made by another former royal servant, George Smith. Charles is considering legal action, but his staff have ruled out the possibility of a televised statement or interview.
