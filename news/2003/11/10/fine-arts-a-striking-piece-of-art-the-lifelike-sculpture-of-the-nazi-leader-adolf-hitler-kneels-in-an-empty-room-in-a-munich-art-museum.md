#  Fine arts: A striking piece of art, the lifelike sculpture of the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler kneels in an empty room in a Munich art museum, Germany (where the Nazi past has made it taboo to display Hitler in any form except in documentary films). The exhibition is at the neo-classical museum, which the Nazi leader ordered built in 1937.
