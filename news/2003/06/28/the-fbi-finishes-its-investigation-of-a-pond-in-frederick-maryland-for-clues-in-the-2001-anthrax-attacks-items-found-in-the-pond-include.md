#  The FBI finishes its investigation of a pond in Frederick, Maryland, for clues in the 2001 anthrax attacks. Items found in the pond include a bicycle, some logs, a street sign, coins, fishing lures, and a handgun. The FBI took soil samples from the bottom of the pond for testing.

FBI investigators found anthrax spores and other evidence in their search of ponds in the area during December and January 2002. Divers retrieved a "clear box" with holes that could accommodate protective biological safety gloves, as well as vials wrapped in plastic from a pond in the Frederick Municipal Forest. A new theory has been developed suggesting how a criminal could have packed anthrax spores into envelopes without harming (him-her) self. Officials from Fort Detrick have stated that the water is safe because once in water anthrax spores cluster together and descend to the bottom. The water in the pond has been tested several times over the course of the investigation, and all indications are that the water is safe.](/news/2003/05/11/ponds-on-the-north-side-of-catoctin-mountain-near-gambrill-park-road-and-tower-road-in-frederick-maryland-are-under-investigation-by-the.md) _Context: 2001 anthrax attacks, FBI, Frederick, Maryland_
