#  In a press conference in Belfast, journalist Sen  Muireagin denies Israeli claims that suspected him of being a Real IRA activist. He states that he is not, and never has been, a member or supporter of the IRA. Israel repeats that the arrest of  Muireagin was "unfortunate", but refuses to apologise. Israel's treatment of  Muireagin is strongly criticised in Ireland. SDLP ex-minister Sean Farren states that  Muireagin is "well known and respected" in Northern Ireland.
