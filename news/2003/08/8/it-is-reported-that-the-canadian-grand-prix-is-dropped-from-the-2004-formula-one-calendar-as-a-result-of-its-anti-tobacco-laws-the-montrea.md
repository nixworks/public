##### Formula One
#  It is reported that the Canadian Grand Prix is dropped from the 2004 Formula One calendar as a result of its anti-tobacco laws. The Montreal race was given a grace of seven years before the introduction of the new law, announced in 1997. This comes a week after it was announced that the Belgian GP will be re-introduced in the 2004 season. However, Formula One director general Bernie Ecclestone says that no such decision has been made.
