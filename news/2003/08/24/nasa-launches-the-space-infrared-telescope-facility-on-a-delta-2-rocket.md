1. [A new plane that would fly from London to New York in three hours has just received crucial funding. The aircraft, officially named Quiet Supersonic Transport (QueSST) and dubbed the "Son of Concorde", was proposed by NASA and has just been given the go-ahead by US officials. QueSST could make its maiden voyage in 2021 if all goes according to plan. If so, it will halve the current travel time between London and New York. ](/news/2018/02/13/a-new-plane-that-would-fly-from-london-to-new-york-in-three-hours-has-just-received-crucial-funding-the-aircraft-officially-named-quiet-su.md) _Context: NASA_

The decline in ozone-depleting chemicals, specifically chlorine from chlorofluorocarbon (an effect from the 1980's CFC ban, say the scientists), has resulted in 20 percent less depletion since 2005. ](/news/2018/01/5/nasa-research-published-in-geophysical-research-letters-implies-that-the-ozone-layer-is-starting-to-recover-due-to-man-s-actions-the-de.md) _Context: NASA_
