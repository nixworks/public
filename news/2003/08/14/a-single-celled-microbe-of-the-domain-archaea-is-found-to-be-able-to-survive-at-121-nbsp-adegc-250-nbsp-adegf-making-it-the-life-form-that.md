#  A single-celled microbe, of the domain Archaea, is found to be able to survive at 121&nbsp;degC (250&nbsp;degF), making it the life form that can tolerate the highest temperature. The microbe, temporarily named "Strain 121", which was found 200 mi away from Puget Sound in a hydrothermal vent, may provide clues to when and where life first evolved on Earth. It metabolizes by reducing iron oxide.
