#  Zimbabwe's only opposition newspaper, the "Daily News" ceases publication following a court order that it breached the "Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act" introduced by President Robert Mugabe in 2002. The closure follows an armed raid on the paper's offices by police. One reporter told Reuters that the action was an "unprecedented attack on press freedom".
