##### Bureau of Engraving and Printing
### [ The Bureau of Engraving and Printing of the Treasury Department of the United States releases a new 20 dollar note, aimed at defeating the technological advances of counterfeiters. The note is expected to begin circulating in the fall of 2003; which is five years since the last $20 note was released in 1998. New designs for the $50 and $100 notes will follow in 2004 and 2005. The most distinctive change in the new currency design is in color. It is the first U.S. currency since 1905 to include colors other than green and black. Different colors for different denominations will make it easier to tell one note from another, and more difficult to counterfeit. ](/news/2003/05/13/the-bureau-of-engraving-and-printing-of-the-treasury-department-of-the-united-states-releases-a-new-20-dollar-note-aimed-at-defeating-the.md)
