### [ The journal "Nature" reports that all species of large fish in the world's oceans have been so thoroughly overfished that just 10% of the population that there was in 1950 remains. The scientists who authored the report conclude that the world's oceans are no longer even close to their natural state. Sharks, Atlantic cod, and Pacific sardines are tapped as particularly imperilled with extinction. The scientists recommend drastic measures to reduce ocean fishing. ](/news/2003/05/15/the-journal-nature-reports-that-all-species-of-large-fish-in-the-world-s-oceans-have-been-so-thoroughly-overfished-that-just-10-of-the-p.md)
