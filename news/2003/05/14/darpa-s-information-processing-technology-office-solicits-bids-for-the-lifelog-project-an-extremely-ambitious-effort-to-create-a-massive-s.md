#  DARPA's Information Processing Technology Office solicits bids for the LifeLog project, an extremely ambitious effort to create a massive searchable computer database, "an ontology-based (sub)system that captures, stores, and makes accessible the flow of one person's experience in and interactions with the world&nbsp;... The objective&nbsp;... is to be able to trace the 'threads' of an individual's life in terms of events, states, and relationships".,
