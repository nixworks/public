##### Kassel
# In Kassel, Germany, the trial of Armin Meiwes begins. He is charged with killing and eating Bernd-Jrgen Brandes who was one of 200 people who replied to an Internet advertisement for "a well-built male prepared to be slaughtered and then consumed". The whole episode was videotaped. The case is legally difficult as cannibalism is not explicitly prohibited by the German penal code, and the defence argues that as the victim was willing, no murder took place.
