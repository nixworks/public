# Six police officers are found guilty of crimes against the security of the state as a result of last September's attempted coup against President of Ecuador Rafael Correa who was tear gassed and imprisoned in a hospital. 

A court in Ecuador convicts six policemen of crimes against state security after protests last September in which President Correa was detained.
