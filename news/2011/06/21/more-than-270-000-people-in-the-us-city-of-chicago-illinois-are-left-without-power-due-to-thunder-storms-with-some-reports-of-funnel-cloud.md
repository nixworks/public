##### Chicago, Illinois
# More than 270,000 people in the US city of Chicago, Illinois, are left without power due to thunder storms with some reports of funnel clouds. 

Commonwealth Edison expects to restore power to most of its customers by Thursday night, two days after a violent wave of storms that spawned at least two tornadoes and packed 80 mph winds at one point left about 440,000 customers without electricity throughout the Chicago area.
