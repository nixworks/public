# Bloomberg reports Italian company Prada SpA is planning an initial public offering for the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. 

Prada SpA is seeking to raise as much as $2.6 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering this month that would give the maker of Miu Miu handbags a higher valuation than most of its European rivals.
