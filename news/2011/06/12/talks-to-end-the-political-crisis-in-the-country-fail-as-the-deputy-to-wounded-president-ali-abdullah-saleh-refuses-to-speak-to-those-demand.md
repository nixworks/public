##### Ali Abdullah Saleh
# Talks to end the political crisis in the country fail as the deputy to wounded President Ali Abdullah Saleh refuses to speak to those demanding he cede power. 

Over in Yemen, At least 40 people have been killed in a battle between Yemeni soldiers and Islamic militants on Saturday, local time. According to the country ̔s defense ministry, the soldiers were trying to drive the militants from several southern towns. The Associated Press reported that the fighting around Lawdar and Zinjibar killed 19 soldiers and 21 militants assumed to be members of Al Qaeda although it ̔s not yet clear how closely they are linked. The surrounding Abyan Province is one of Al Qaeda ̔s strongholds in the Arabian Peninsula. In a strange twist, reports say, the army commander who led the battle to drive back the Islamists is one of several top military figures who has turned against the country’s embattled president, Ali Abdullah Saleh.
