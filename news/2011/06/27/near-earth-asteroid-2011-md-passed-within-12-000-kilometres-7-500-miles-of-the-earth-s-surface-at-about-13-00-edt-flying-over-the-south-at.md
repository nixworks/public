##### Near-Earth asteroid
# Near-Earth Asteroid 2011 MD passed within 12,000 kilometres (7,500 miles) of the Earth's surface at about 13:00 EDT flying over the South Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Antarctica. 

An asteroid set to pass within 12,000 kilometres of Earth tonight is a timely reminder there is more to our environment than meets the eye.
