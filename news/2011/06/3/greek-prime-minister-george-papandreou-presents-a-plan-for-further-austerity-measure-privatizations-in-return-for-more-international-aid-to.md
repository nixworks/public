##### Greek prime minister
# Greek prime minister, George Papandreou presents a plan for further austerity-measure privatizations in return for more international aid to avoid defaulting on its debt following a 110 billion Euro bailout last year that has so far failed to resolve the Greek economic crisis; Greece's main labor unions have called for a general strike on June 15. 

Greece is set to impose further austerity measures and a number of privatization plans in return for more international aid to avoid defaulting on its debt.
