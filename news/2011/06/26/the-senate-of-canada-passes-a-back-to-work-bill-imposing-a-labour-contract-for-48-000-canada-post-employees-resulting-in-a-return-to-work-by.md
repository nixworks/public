##### Canadian Senate
# The Senate of Canada passes a back-to-work bill imposing a labour contract for 48,000 Canada Post employees resulting in a return-to-work by Tuesday. 

Canadian homes and businesses will start receiving mail again Tuesday after legislation forcing 48,000 locked-out postal workers back to their jobs became law, Canada Post says.
