# In the United Kingdom, the cheque guarantee card scheme &ndash; which ensures some cheques are honoured even if the account holder does not have sufficient funds in their account &ndash; is being withdrawn today after operating for over 40 years. 

The final operating day of cheque guarantee cards - which ensure some cheques are honoured - is on Thursday.
