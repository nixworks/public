# The Pakistani media reports Defence Minister Ahmad Mukhtar as claiming that the United States will no longer be able to use the Shamsi Airfield to launch drone attacks on militants. 

Pakistan has stopped the United States from using an air base in the southwest of the country to launch drone strikes against militant groups, the defense minister was quoted as saying, as ties remain strained between the two countries.
