##### Department of Agriculture
# The U.S. Department of Agriculture says it has deregulated a genetically engineered corn. See genetically modified food. The corn in question is designed for the manufacture of ethanol. 

The Agriculture Department said on Friday it has deregulated a variety of corn genetically engineered to produce a common enzyme that speeds the breakdown of starch into sugar, a vital step in making ethanol.
