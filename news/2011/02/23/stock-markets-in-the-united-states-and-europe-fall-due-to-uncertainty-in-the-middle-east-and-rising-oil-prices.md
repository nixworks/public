# Stock markets in the United States and Europe fall due to uncertainty in the Middle East and rising oil prices. 

Oil rallied, touching $100 a barrel in New York for the first time since October 2008, as Libyaâ€™s uprising threatened to halt exports. Stocks fell amid concern higher energy costs will slow economic growth, while Treasuries dropped after a $35 billion auction.
