# North Korea warns it will take military action against South Korea if it continues to distribute information regarding the unrest in the Middle East to its citizens. 

North Korea threatened to take military action if the South continues to drop leaflets and other propaganda encouraging revolt, threatening a return of tension on the peninsula that roiled markets last year.
