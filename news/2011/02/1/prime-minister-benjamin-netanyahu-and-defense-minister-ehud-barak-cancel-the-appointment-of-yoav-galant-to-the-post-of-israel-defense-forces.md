# Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak cancel the appointment of Yoav Galant to the post of Israel Defense Forces chief. The announcement came after months of scandal surrounding his appointment due to allegations that he had illegally seized public lands near his home in Moshav Amikam, and after the State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss stated that Galant lied to in a sworn affidavit about exceeding his building rights.
