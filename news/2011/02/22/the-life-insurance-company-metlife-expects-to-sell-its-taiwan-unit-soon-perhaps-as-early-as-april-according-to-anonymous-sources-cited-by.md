# The life insurance company Metlife expects to sell its Taiwan unit soon, perhaps as early as April, according to anonymous sources cited by Reuters. Regulators blocked an early effort by MetLife to sell the same unit. 

U.S. life insurer Metlife Inc (MET.N) has drawn three bidders for its Taiwan unit and is expected to seal a deal by as early as April, a source with direct knowledge of the situation said on Tuesday.
