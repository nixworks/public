# NASA's Kepler Mission announces the discovery of a planetary system of six planets circulating the star Kepler-11. 

NASAs Kepler mission has discovered a planetary system including six planets orbiting a Sun-like star called Kepler-11, located approximately 2,000 light years from Earth. Kepler-11 is a remarkable system whose architecture and dynamics provide clues about its formation, said
