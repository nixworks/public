##### Julian Assange
# The defence team for Julian Assange, facing allegations of sex crimes, prepares to argue that Assange cannot receive a fair trial in Sweden as such cases are heard in secret without any transparency. 

LONDON: Julian Assange&#039;s defence team is to argue that he cannot be given a fair trial in Sweden because all rape cases are heard in secret - and justice cannot be seen to be done.
