##### Southern United States
# Fourteen states in the Southern United States are on a heat alert with several dozen deaths since July as part of a heat wave. 

The National Weather Service chief calls it a heat wave more intense than any he can recall. It&#39;s particularly bad in Texas, where high electricity use triggered power outages Thursday.
