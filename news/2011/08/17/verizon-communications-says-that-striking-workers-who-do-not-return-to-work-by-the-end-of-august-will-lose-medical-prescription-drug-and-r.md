# Verizon Communications says that striking workers who do not return to work by the end of August will lose medical, prescription drug, and related benefits. 

Verizon Communications Inc. told 45,000 striking workers that it will suspend certain benefits at the end of the month if they haven’t returned to their jobs, a move that a union official called a “scare” tactic.
