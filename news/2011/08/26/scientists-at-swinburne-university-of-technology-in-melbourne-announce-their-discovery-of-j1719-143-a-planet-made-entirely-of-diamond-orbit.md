# Scientists at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne announce their discovery of J1719-143, a planet made entirely of diamond orbiting a pulsar - only the second time such a planetary mass has been discovered. 

The discovery of a small, fast-spinning star known as a pulsar has led to astronomers to detect a companion planet, likely made of diamond.
