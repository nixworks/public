##### Alexander Ankvab
# Alexander Ankvab is elected President of partially recognized Abkhazia during elections held on August, 26. The elections are characterised by the Western media and independent observers as "democratic", but not recognized by Georgia.

Observers said the results would not alter politics in a rebel enclave of Georgia struggling for legitimacy after Russia declared it a sovereign nation.
