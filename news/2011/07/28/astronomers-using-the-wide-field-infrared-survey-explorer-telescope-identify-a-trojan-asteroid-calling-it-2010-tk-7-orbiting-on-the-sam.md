##### Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
# Astronomers using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer telescope identify a Trojan asteroid, calling it "2010 TK 7 ", orbiting on the same path as the Earth around the Sun. The rock poses no danger to the Earth since it sits in a what is termed a gravitational "sweet spot". 

Astronomers detect an asteroid not far from Earth, moving in the same orbit around the Sun, that could be a target for future manned space missions.
