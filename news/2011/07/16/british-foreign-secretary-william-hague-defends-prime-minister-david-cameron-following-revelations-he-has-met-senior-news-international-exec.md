# British Foreign Secretary William Hague defends Prime Minister David Cameron following revelations he has met senior News International executives on 26 occasions since becoming Prime Minister, and entertained Andy Coulson at Chequers following his resignation as Director of Communications. Hague says he is "not embarrassed" by the extent of Cameron's dealings with News International. 

Rupert Murdoch takes out national press adverts to apologise for the phone hacking by the News of the World, as two of his most senior executives resign.
