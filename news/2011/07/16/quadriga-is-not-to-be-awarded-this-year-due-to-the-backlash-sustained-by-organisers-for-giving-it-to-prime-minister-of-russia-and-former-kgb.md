##### Quadriga
# Quadriga is not to be awarded this year due to the backlash sustained by organisers for giving it to Prime Minister of Russia and former KGB spy chief Vladimir Putin. Among the upheaval Danish artist Olafur Eliasson gave back his award and Vaclav Havel was reported to be considering doing that too. 

Russian PM Vladimir Putin will no longer be awarded a prestigious German rights prize after the move was widely criticised.
