##### Court of Appeals
# A U.S. Court of Appeals holds that isolated DNA is "markedly different" in its chemical structure from the DNA within chromosomes, and thus is not simply a product of nature but of human ingenuity. According, the court upholds two patents held by Myriad Genetics against challenge. 

A federal appeals court ruled on Friday that genes can be patented, overturning a lower court decision that had shocked the biotechnology industry.
