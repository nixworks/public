# The President of the United States, Barack Obama, gives Congressional leader 24 to 36 hours to reach an agreement on debt reduction as credit agency Standard & Poor's places the US on a downgrade watch. 

Shortly after President Obama and congressional leaders ended their meeting on the debt ceiling, the White House announced a Friday-morning news conference.
