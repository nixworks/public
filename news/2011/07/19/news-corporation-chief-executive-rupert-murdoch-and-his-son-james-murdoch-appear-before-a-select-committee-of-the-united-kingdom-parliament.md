# News Corporation Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch and his son James Murdoch appear before a select committee of the United Kingdom parliament over the "News of the World" phone hacking affair. Murdoch Senior apologises for the scandal, but says he is not responsible for it. 

Rupert Murdoch, unfazed by a foam pie attack in the British parliament, made a &quot;humble&quot; apology on Tuesday for crimes that have rocked his media empire and the government but refused to resign, saying the fault lay with staff who &quot;betrayed&quot; him.
