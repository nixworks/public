##### Chicago, Illinois
# Heavy thunderstorms with 75 mph winds, in the US city of Chicago, Illinois, cut power and disrupt transport. 

Commonwealth Edison Co. reported substantial progress in restoring power lost in Monday&apos;s storms but that still left hundreds of thousands without electricity in sweltering heat. The utility warned it could take days to get everyone back on line.
