# 2011 Moroccan protests: Democracy campaigners dismiss as "unbelievable" government figures showing that 98 per cent of voters backed Morocco's constitutional referendum amid allegations of multiple voting, with people marching through Rabat, Casablanca and Tangier chanting "The interior minister is a liar". 

At least 21 people have died in heavy fighting near the rebel-held southern Yemen city of Zinjibar, reports say.
