# Thailand votes in its 26th general election with results showing the Pheu Thai Party loyal to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra winning a majority. Yingluck Shinawatra, the opposition party leader, is expected to be the first female Prime Minister of Thailand. 

The sister of ousted leader Thaksin Shinawatra was set for victory in Thailandâ€™s elections, five years since he was deposed in a coup, after Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva conceded defeat.
