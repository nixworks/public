# Republicans in the United States House of Representatives announce they will delay a vote on extending the debt ceiling until Thursday due to concerns over level of proposed savings not being sufficient. 

House Republicans delayed a vote on their bill to lift the debt ceiling as they scrambled Tuesday night to rewrite the measure to ensure that accompanying spending cuts were large enough, according to three senior GOP aides.
