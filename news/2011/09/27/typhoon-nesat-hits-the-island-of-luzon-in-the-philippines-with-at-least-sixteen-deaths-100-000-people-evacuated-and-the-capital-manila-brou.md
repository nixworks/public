##### Typhoon Nesat
# Typhoon Nesat hits the island of Luzon in the Philippines with at least sixteen deaths, 100,000 people evacuated and the capital Manila brought to a standstill. 

Manila residents waded through waist-deep floodwaters and dodged flying debris Tuesday as a powerful typhoon struck the Philippines, killing at least 16 people and sending waves as tall as palm trees crashing over seawalls.
