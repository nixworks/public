##### Austin, Texas
# Approximately 5,000 people are evacuated from their homes near the U.S. city of Austin, Texas, with wildfires caused in part by Tropical Storm Lee causing concerns in other parts of the state. 

No longer a hurricane, Lee continued to drench the South and fuel wildfires in Texas.
