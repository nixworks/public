##### Health Services Union
# The Health Services Union disaffiliates from the Australian Labor Party in the states of New South Wales and Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, following the commencement of a New South Wales Police Force investigation into alleged "inappropriate practices" by current and former union officials, including Craig Thomson, a member of the House of Representatives. 

A civil war has broken out in the Health Services Union after president Michael Williamson refused to step down as police investigate alleged &#034;inappropriate practices&#034;.
