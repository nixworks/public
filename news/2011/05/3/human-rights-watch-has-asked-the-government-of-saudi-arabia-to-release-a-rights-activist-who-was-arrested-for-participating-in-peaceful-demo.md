##### Saudi Arabian protests
# Human Rights Watch has asked the government of Saudi Arabia to release a rights activist who was arrested for participating in peaceful demonstrations, saying a recent wave of arrests is jeopardizing any chance of reform. 

Saudi Arabia, the worldâ€™s largest oil exporter, arrested a Shiite human rights activist in the oil-producing Eastern Province, extending a crackdown aimed at quashing political unrest, Human Rights Watch said.
