# British authorities refuse asylum to 22-year-old Betty Tibikawa, homophobically attacked by three men in Uganda, despite deputy prime minister Nick Clegg's claim that his government would stop its policy of deporting people who are persecuted over their sexual orientation. The British government is currently detaining Ms. Tibikawa at a facility in Bedford.
