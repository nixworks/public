##### Queen Elizabeth II
# Queen Elizabeth II starts her first state visit to the Republic of Ireland, the first visit of a British monarch since Ireland's independence from the United Kingdom in 1921. Elizabeth is also the first British monarch to visit Ireland since George V's state visit in 1911. 

The Queen is due to begin the first visit to the Republic of Ireland by a British monarch, amid a huge security operation for the four-day trip.
