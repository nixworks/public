# Vietnamese soldiers clash with thousands of Hmong Christians in Dien Bien Province demanding religious freedom and autonomy in the northwest of the country, in the worst ethnic unrest in Vietnam in years. The US-based Center for Public Policy Analysis claims that at least 28 protesters were killed and hundreds more were missing, while 3,000 protesters remained at the site, according to officials. 

Thousands of ethnic Hmong people in Vietnam stage a protest calling for autonomy in a rare outbreak of unrest, a local official tells the BBC.
