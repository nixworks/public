# Members of the Falun Gong spiritual movement in the People's Republic of Chinafile a lawsuit in the United States against Cisco, maker of internet routing gear, alleging Cisco has helped China's government violate their human rights. 

The suit, filed by a rights group, was based on Cisco sales materials. Cisco said there was “no basis” for the claims and that it would “vigorously” defend itself.
