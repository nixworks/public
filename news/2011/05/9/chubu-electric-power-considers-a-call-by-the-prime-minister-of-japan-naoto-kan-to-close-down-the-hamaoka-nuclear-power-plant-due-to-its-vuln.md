##### Chubu Electric Power
# Chubu Electric Power considers a call by the Prime Minister of Japan Naoto Kan to close down the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant due to its vulnerability to a large earthquake. 

Japanese power firm Chubu Electric on Monday agreed to shut a nuclear plant until it can be better defended against the type of massive tsunami that in March triggered the worst atomic crisis in 25 years.
