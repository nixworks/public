##### Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa
# Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa issue a joint statement criticising Europe's 66-year stranglehold on the leadership of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), calling it "obsolete" and requesting that developing nations be given a chance. 

Historically, a European has led the international financial body, but emerging economies want that to change.
