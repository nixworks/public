##### MG Rover
# Peter Beale, Nick Stephenson, John Edwards and John Towers - the so-called "Phoenix Four" who ran MG Rover following its collapse - have agreed to be disqualified from serving as company directors for between 3 and 6 years. The deal was made with the UK's Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, following a "lengthy and complex investigation" into the affair. 

The bosses who ran MG Rover when it collapsed have been banned from serving as directors of any company for up to six years.
