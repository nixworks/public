##### Bob Dylan
# Musician Bob Dylan responds on his website to allegations he gave in to censorship during a recent series of concerts in China, including criticism from "The New York Times" over his failure to mention the plight of imprisoned artist and dissident Ai Weiwei. 

Legendary folk-rock singer Bob Dylan insists he was not censored by Chinese authorities ahead of concerts he performed there earlier this year.
