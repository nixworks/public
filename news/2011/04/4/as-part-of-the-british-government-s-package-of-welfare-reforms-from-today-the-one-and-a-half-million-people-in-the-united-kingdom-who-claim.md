# As part of the British government's package of welfare reforms, from today the one-and-a-half million people in the United Kingdom who claim incapacity benefit will begin to receive letters asking them to attend a work capability assessment. The tests are part of government plans to reduce the number of long-term claimants and will take until 2014 to complete. 

The 1.5 million people who claim incapacity benefit will start to receive letters this week asking them to be tested on their ability to work.
