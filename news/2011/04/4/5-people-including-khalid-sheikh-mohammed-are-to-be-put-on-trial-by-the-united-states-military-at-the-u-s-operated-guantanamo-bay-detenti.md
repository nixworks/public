##### Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
# 5 people, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, are to be put on trial by the United States military at the U.S.-operated Guantanamo Bay detention camp, it is announced. 

The alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks and four alleged co-conspirators will be tried at Guantanamo Bay, rather than a US civilian court.
