##### Ai Weiwei
# China's foreign ministry confirms police are investigating artist and government critic Ai Weiwei, who disappeared over the weekend, for suspected economic crimes amid reports that he has been force-fed milk powder while on hunger strike in prison in reference to his campaigns against the 2008 Chinese milk scandal. 

China confirms the detained artist, Ai Weiwei, is being investigated for &quot;economic crimes&quot; as another activist alleges he was tortured while in jail.
