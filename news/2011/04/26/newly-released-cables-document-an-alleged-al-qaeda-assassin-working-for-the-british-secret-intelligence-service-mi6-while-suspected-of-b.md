# Newly released cables document an alleged al-Qaeda "assassin" working for the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) while suspected of bombing Christian churches and a hotel in Pakistan. 

Two reports of Wikileaks files claim an alleged al-Qaeda &quot;assassin&quot; was working for MI6 at the same time he is suspected of bombings in Pakistan, and that a London mosque was a &quot;haven&quot; for extremists.
