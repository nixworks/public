##### Large Hadron Collider
# The Large Hadron Collider makes its first clear observation of a new particle since opening in 2009, the boson Chi b 3P. 

The first clear evidence for a new particle at the Large Hadron Collider emerges, which may make finding particles such as the Higgs boson easier.
