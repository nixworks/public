# A Russian nuclear submarine, the K-84 "Ekaterinburg", is forced to partially submerge itself at a shipyard in Murmansk to douse a blaze on its hull. No radiation leaks are reported. 

Russia said it had won the battle with a raging blaze aboard a nuclear submarine on Friday by submerging the stricken vessel at a navy shipyard after hours of dousing the flames with water from helicopters and tug boats.
