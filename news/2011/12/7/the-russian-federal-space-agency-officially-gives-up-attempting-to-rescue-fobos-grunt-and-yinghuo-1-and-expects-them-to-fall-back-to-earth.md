##### Russian Federal Space Agency
# The Russian Federal Space Agency officially gives up attempting to rescue Fobos-Grunt and Yinghuo-1, and expects them to fall back to Earth in January 2012. 

The troubled Russian Phobos-Grunt spacecraft, which has been stuck in low-Earth orbit since early November, appears to be doomed, with small pieces of the wayward Mars probe already falling to Earth.
