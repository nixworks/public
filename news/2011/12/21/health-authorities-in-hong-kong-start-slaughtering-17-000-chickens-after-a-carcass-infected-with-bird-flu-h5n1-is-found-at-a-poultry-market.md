# Health authorities in Hong Kong start slaughtering 17,000 chickens after a carcass infected with bird flu H5N1 is found at a poultry market. 

The culling is part of a series of precautionary steps being taken after the chicken carcass was found to have a “highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus,” officials said.
