##### Wukan
# The population of the village of Wukan in southern China revolt over the death of a local man who led protests against a land grab; local officials and police flee. 

Chinese officials have ratcheted up pressure on the rebel village of Wukan, as it entered its fourth day of a police siege, by allegedly ransoming four men who were seized from the village last week.
