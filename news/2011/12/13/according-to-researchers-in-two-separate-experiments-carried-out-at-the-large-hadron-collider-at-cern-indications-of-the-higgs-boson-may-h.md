##### Large Hadron Collider
# According to researchers, in two separate experiments carried out at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, indications of the Higgs boson may have been detected. 

Scientists eagerly await an announcement that will present the best evidence yet for - or against - the existence of the fabled Higgs boson particle.
