# NASA observes the asteroid YU 55 as it makes a close Earth flyby, passing within 0.85 lunar distances (about 201,700 miles) of the Earth. YU 55 is approximately 400 m across, and is the largest asteroid to make a close pass since 1976. 

A 400m-wide asteroid passes by Earth, on a path closer to the planet than the Moon, much to the delight of astronomers.
