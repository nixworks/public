# Tajikistan hints that it may release a Russian pilot detained on charges of smuggling, after Russia deports hundreds of Tajik migrant workers. 

Tajikistan has suggested it could free a Russian pilot sentenced to eight and a half years in jail after an extraordinary backlash from Moscow threatened to ruin the Central Asian country&#039;s entire economy.
