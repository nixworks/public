##### Hellenic Parliament
# The Hellenic Parliament rejects a no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister of Greece George Papandreou following a failed attempt to hold a referendum on a Eurozone bailout. 

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou has won a confidence vote in the parliament in Athens, distancing the prospect of early elections that could push the country to default.
