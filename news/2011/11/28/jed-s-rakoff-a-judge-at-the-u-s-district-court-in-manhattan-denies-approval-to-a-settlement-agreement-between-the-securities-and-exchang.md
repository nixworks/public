# Jed S. Rakoff, a judge at the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, denies approval to a settlement agreement between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the investment bank Citigroup, which the SEC has charged with deceiving investors about the conditions under which a certain portfolio's investments had been chosen. 

Judge Jed Rakoff said the proposed $285 million settlement over the sale of toxic mortgage debt was “neither fair, nor adequate, nor in the public interest” and ordered a trial.
