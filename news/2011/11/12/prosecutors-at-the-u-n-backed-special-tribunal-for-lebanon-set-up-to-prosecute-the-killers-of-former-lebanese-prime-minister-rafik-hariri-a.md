##### Special Tribunal for Lebanon
# Prosecutors at the U.N.-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon set up to prosecute the killers of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri ask judges to defer a decision to hold a trial "in absentia" for four Hezbollah members indicted in Hariri's assassination. 

The Special Tribunal for Lebanonâ€™s most high-profile hearing to date ended in stalemate Friday as rival counsels traded blows over in-absentia trials for suspects.
