# The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upholds a lower court ruling that halted the efforts of two large banks to foreclose in cases in which they failed to prove they were holding the mortgages in question. 

The ruling voided two foreclosures, putting the nation’s banks on notice that foreclosures cannot be based on improper or incomplete paperwork.
