# Ghana says a threat of force by the Economic Community of West African States to remove Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo would "not bring about peace" in the country. 

A plan by West African leaders for a military intervention in Ivory Coastâ€™s political conflict is not likely to bring peace to the country, said John Atta Mills, president of neighboring Ghana.
