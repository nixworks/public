# 2010 tied for the warmest year ever recorded, and the last decade was the warmest ever recorded, since records began in the 1800s.

Last year tied for the hottest year on record, confirming a long-term warming trend which will continue unless greenhouse gas emissions are cut, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Thursday.
