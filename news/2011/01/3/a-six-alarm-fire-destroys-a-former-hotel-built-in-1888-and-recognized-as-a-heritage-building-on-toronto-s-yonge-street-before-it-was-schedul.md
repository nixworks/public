# A six-alarm fire destroys a former hotel built in 1888 and recognized as a heritage building on Toronto's Yonge Street before it was scheduled for demolition; the fire forced the temporary closure of Ryerson University and nearby schools and hot spots remained a danger after extinguishing the fire. Two firefighters who fell into the building were rescued uninjured while arson remains a suspected cause. 

The face of Yonge Street in Downtown Toronto has been forever changed thanks to a massive early morning blaze.
