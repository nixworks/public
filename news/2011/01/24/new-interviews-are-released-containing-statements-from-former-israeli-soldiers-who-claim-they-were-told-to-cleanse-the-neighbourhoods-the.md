# New interviews are released containing statements from former Israeli soldiers who claim they were told to "cleanse the neighbourhoods, the buildings, the area" and that the offensive should be disproportionate, with tank operators being told to shell any car that comes near them during the War on Gaza. 

Israel&#039;s controversial invasion of Gaza deliberately aimed to &#034;cleanse&#034; Palestinian neighbourhoods, former soldiers have alleged, in claims that will reignite the debate over the legality of the three week military campaign.
