# Egypt's general prosecutor bans media reporting of the investigation into a deadly New Year's Day church bombing, saying any revelations could hinder the work of investigators, a day after Egypt's government accused a Palestinian militant group, the Army of Islam, of carrying out the bombing with the help of a local accomplice.
