##### EastEnders
# Viewers of UK soap opera "EastEnders" complain in record numbers about a "hurtful", "unrealistic" and "exploitative" cot death storyline as the BBC sets out to meet the grieving mothers it has upset. 

The switchboard lights at the BBC&#039;s complaints centre began to flash even before the closing credits rolled on the New Year&#039;s Eve edition of EastEnders. It was not long before the email inbox was filling rapidly as viewers – many of them bereaved mothers and fathers – gave vent to their feelings after the character Ronnie Branning switched her dead baby with Kat Slater&#039;s newborn child.
