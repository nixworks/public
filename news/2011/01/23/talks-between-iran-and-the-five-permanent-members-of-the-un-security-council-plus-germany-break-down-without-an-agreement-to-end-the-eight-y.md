# Talks between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany break down without an agreement to end the eight-year-old impasse over Iran's nuclear program, after Iranian officials refused to negotiate unless preconditions including an immediate halt to UN sanctions on Iran were met. 

Negotiations to resolve the stand-off over Iran&#039;s nuclear programme have ended in deadlock &ndash; raising fears that its regime could accelerate its nuclear weapons programme, potentially sparking off a dangerous Middle East crisis.
