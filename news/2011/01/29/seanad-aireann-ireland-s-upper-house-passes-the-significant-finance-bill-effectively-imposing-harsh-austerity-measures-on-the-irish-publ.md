##### Seanad Eireann
# Seanad Eireann, Ireland's upper house, passes the significant Finance Bill, effectively imposing harsh austerity measures on the Irish public. It is the last act carried out by the government before a general election is called. 

The Finance Bill will not go to the D&aacute;il tonight after the Seanad passed the Bill by 30 votes to 20 without accepting any Opposition&hellip;
