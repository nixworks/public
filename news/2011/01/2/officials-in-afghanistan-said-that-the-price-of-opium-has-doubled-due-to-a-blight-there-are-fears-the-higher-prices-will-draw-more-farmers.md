# Officials in Afghanistan said that the price of opium has doubled due to a blight. There are fears the higher prices will draw more farmers into that business. 

Opium prices have almost doubled after a blight halved production in 2010, Afghan officials said on Sunday, raising fears more farmers would turn to the illicit crop in the absence of profitable alternatives.
