# Iranian human-rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh is sentenced to 11 years in prison and banned from practicing law or traveling for 20 years; France condemns the punishment as "deeply shocking" and called for the release of Sotoudeh and another activist, Shiva Nazar-Ahari, who was sentenced to four years in prison and 74 lashes. 

Nasrin Sotoudeh, a female human rights lawyer, has been sentenced to 11 years in jail for crimes that include “activities against national security” and “propaganda against the regime.”
