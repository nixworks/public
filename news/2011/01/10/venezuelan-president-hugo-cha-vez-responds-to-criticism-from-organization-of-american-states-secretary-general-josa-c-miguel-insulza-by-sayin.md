# Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez responds to criticism from Organization of American States Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza by saying the OAS is interfering in the country's internal affairs and referring to Insulza as a "spokesman of the empire" during a radio address. 

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez accuses the OAS of interference after its secretary general condemned a law giving him special powers.
