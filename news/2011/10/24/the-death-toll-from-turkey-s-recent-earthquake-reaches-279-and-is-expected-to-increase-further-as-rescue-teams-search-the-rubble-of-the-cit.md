# The death toll from Turkey's recent earthquake reaches 279, and is expected to increase further as rescue teams search the rubble of the city of Van for survivors. Meanwhile, thousands made homeless by the quake are forced to endure freezing overnight temperatures in the open. 

The death toll from a powerful earthquake in south-eastern Turkey rises above 200, with more than 1,000 people injured, officials say.
