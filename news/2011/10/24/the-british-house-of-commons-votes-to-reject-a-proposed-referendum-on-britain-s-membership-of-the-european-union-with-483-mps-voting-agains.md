# The British House of Commons votes to reject a proposed referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, with 483 MPs voting against the proposal and 111 voting in favour. Among those who supported the proposal were 81 Conservative Party members, who rebelled against the anti-referendum stance of Prime Minister David Cameron, the leader of the Conservative Party. 

The prime minister comfortably defeats an attempt to bring about a referendum on Europe, despite a sizeable rebellion by Conservative MPs.
