# A bill to takeover the capital city of Harrisburg, rather than have it file for Chapter 9, clears the Pennsylvania State Legislature. The Governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Corbett, is expected to sign it. 

The Pennsylvania state Senate on Tuesday voted for a state takeover of the finances of its capital, Harrisburg, setting up a showdown with the city, which filed for bankruptcy last week.
