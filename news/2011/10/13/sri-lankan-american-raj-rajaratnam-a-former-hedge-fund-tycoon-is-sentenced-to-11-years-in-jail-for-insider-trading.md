##### Sri Lankan-American
# Sri Lankan-American Raj Rajaratnam, a former hedge fund tycoon, is sentenced to 11 years in jail for insider trading. 

Raj Rajaratnam, a self-made hedge fund tycoon convicted in the biggest Wall Street trading scandal in a generation, was ordered to serve 11 years in prison, the longest sentence ever in an insider-trading case but far less than prosecutors sought.
