# Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's cuts Spain's credit rating to AA- with a negative outlook, as the European debt crisis deepens. 

Spain’s credit rating was cut for the third time in three years by Standard &amp; Poor’s as slowing growth and rising defaults threaten banks and undermine efforts to contain Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.
