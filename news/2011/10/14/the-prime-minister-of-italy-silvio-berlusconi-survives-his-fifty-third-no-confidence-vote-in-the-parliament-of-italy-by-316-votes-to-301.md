##### Prime Minister of Italy
# The Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, survives his fifty-third no-confidence vote in the Parliament of Italy by 316 votes to 301. 

The prime ministerâ€™s center-right coalition failed to secure a solid majority, making it increasingly difficult for him to pass legislation.
