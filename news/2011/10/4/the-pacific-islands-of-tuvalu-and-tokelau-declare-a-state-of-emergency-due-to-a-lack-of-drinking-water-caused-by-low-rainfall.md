# The Pacific islands of Tuvalu and Tokelau declare a state of emergency due to a lack of drinking water caused by low rainfall. 

Tokelau, a tiny Pacific archipelago administered by New Zealand, has joined neighbouring Tuvalu in declaring a state of emergency, saying it has only a few days&#039; drinking water left.
