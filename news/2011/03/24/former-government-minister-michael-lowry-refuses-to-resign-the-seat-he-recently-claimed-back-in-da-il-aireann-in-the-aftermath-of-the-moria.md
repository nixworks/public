# Former government minister Michael Lowry refuses to resign the seat he recently claimed back in Dail Eireann in the aftermath of the Moriarty Tribunal's findings that he assisted billionaire businessman Denis O'Brien "beyond doubt" in gaining a mobile phone license for Esat Digifone, in actions judged "disgraceful and insidious" by the tribunal. Taoiseach Enda Kenny admits Fine Gael accepted a donation worth thousands of dollars from Esat at the time. 

Irish billionaire businessman Denis O&#039;Brien and a former Irish government minister have been accused of being involved in a &#034;cynical and venal abuse of power&#034; in negotiations for a substantial mobile telephone licence.
