At least ten people are dead, one person is missing and presumed dead, about 80 are wounded, and 17 are seriously or critically injured. The rescue is difficult - resembling a mountain-type rescue - because of a nearby river and a steep incline and a curve in the tracks; rescue helicopters had to be used. It is one of Bavaria's and Germany's deadliest-ever railroad accidents. Human error is being examined as a possibility. ](/news/2016/02/9/two-passenger-trains-collide-in-the-german-town-of-bad-aibling-in-the-state-of-bavaria-at-least-ten-people-are-dead-one-person-is-missing.md) _Context: Bavaria, Germany_
