# The United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office is investigating claims that a man from the English city of Manchester has been killed in the 2011 Libyan civil war. 

Libyan forces loyal to leader Muammar Gaddafi fought their way into a town near the capital that has for days defied his rule, killing a rebel commander and pinning fighters into pockets of resistance.
