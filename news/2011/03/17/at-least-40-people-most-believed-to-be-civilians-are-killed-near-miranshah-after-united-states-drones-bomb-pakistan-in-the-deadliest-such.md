##### Miranshah
# At least 40 people, most believed to be civilians, are killed near Miranshah after United States drones bomb Pakistan in the deadliest such attack by the United States since 2006. Tribesmen describe a "massacre" as tribal people, elders, local traders and members of the tribal police are killed. 

At least 40 people, most of them civilians, have been killed in a US drone strike in the Pakistani tribal region of North Waziristan, officials say.
