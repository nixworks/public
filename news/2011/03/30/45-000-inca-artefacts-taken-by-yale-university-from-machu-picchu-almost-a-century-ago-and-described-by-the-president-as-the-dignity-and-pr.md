# 45,000 Inca artefacts taken by Yale University from Machu Picchu almost a century ago, and described by the president as "the dignity and pride of Peru", arrive in Lima after a long campaign by Peruvians to have them returned. 

Peru gives a grandiose welcome to hundreds of Inca artefacts returned by Yale University, nearly a century after they were taken from the lost city of Machu Picchu.

Keiko Fujimori is the front runner in Sunday's April 10, 2016, election. Yesterday, Fujimori committed to respect democratic liberties and the rule of law, and to work against corruption, which some opponents have rejected. The Organization of American States says the election could lack credibility unless two recently disqualified candidates are allowed to run. ](/news/2016/04/5/peruvians-protest-in-five-cities-including-the-capital-lima-against-the-presidential-candidacy-of-keiko-fujimori-daughter-of-imprisoned-e.md) _Context: Lima_
