##### Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant
# The Tokyo Electric Power Co. says that it will scrap at least four units at the Fukushima I Power Plant and warns that fixing the problem will be a drawn out process. 

Japan called on the world not to impose &quot;unjustifiable&quot; import curbs on its goods as French President Nicolas Sarkozy was due to arrive on Thursday, the first leader to visit since an earthquake and tsunami damaged a nuclear plant, sparking the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986.
