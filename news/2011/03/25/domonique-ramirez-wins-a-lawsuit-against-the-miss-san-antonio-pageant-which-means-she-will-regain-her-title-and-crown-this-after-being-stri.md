# Domonique Ramirez wins a lawsuit against the Miss San Antonio pageant which means she will regain her title and crown, this after being stripped of her title for being "overweight". 

A jury has ruled that pageant organizers breached their contract when they harassed a Texas beauty queen about her weight and wrongly stripped her of her crown.
