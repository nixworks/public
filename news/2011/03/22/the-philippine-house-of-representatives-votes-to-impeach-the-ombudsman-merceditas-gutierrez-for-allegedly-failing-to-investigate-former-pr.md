##### House of Representatives
# The Philippine House of Representatives votes to impeach the Ombudsman, Merceditas Gutierrez, for allegedly failing to investigate former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and other senior officials of her administration with sufficient vigor. 

Philippine lawmakers have impeached the country&#x27;s chief anti-graft investigator in what new President Benigno Aquino&#x27;s backers say is a victory in efforts to remove an obstacle to prosecuting his predecessor and other top officials for alleged massive corruption.
