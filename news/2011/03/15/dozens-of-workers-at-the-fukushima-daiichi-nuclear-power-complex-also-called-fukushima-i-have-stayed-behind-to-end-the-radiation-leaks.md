# Dozens of workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power complex (also called "Fukushima I") have stayed behind to end the radiation leaks, known as the "Fukushima 50", risking fatal radiation exposure. 

Japan faced the likelihood of a catastrophic nuclear accident after an explosion further damaged one of the crippled reactors and a fire at another spewed large amounts of radioactive material into the air.
