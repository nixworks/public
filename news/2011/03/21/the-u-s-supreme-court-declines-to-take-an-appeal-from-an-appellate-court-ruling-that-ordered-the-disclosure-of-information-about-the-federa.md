##### Supreme Court of the United States
# The U.S. Supreme Court declines to take an appeal from an appellate court ruling that ordered the disclosure of information about the Federal Reserve's emergency lending to banks during the 2008 financial crisis. The Supreme Court's refusal means the ruling of the court below stands. 

The Supreme Court let stand a ruling that the U.S. Federal Reserve must disclose details about its emergency lending programs to banks during the financial crisis in 2008.
