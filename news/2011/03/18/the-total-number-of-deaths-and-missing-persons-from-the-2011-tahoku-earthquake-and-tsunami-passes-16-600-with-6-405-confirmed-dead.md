##### 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami
# The total number of deaths and missing persons from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami passes 16,600 with 6,405 confirmed dead. 

A US agency helping Japan tackle its nuclear crisis at a stricken nuclear power plant says there is no water in one of the reactor&#039;s pools, leading to &#034;extremely high&#034; radiation levels.
