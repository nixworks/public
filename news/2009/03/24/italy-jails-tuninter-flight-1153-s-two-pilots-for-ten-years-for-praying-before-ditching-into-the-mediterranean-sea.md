#  Italy jails Tuninter Flight 1153's two pilots for ten years for praying before ditching into the Mediterranean Sea. 

A Tunisian pilot who paused to pray instead of taking emergency measures before crash-landing his plane, killing 16 people, has been sentenced to 10 years in jail by an Italian court along with his co-pilot.
