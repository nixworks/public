#  FedEx Express Flight 80 crashes at Narita International Airport in Tokyo, Japan, killing both pilots. 

Wind shear may have caused the crash of a FedEx jet that cartwheeled on the runway at Tokyo&#39;s main international airport and burst into a fireball, investigators said Monday, but experts noted that the model was notoriously difficult to land.
