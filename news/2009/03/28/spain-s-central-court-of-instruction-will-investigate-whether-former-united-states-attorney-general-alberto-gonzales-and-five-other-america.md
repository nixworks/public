#  Spain's Central Court of Instruction will investigate whether former United States Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and five other American officials violated international law by justifying torture. 

A case that could lead to arrest warrants will examine whether officials wrongly contrived a legal framework that led to abuses of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.
