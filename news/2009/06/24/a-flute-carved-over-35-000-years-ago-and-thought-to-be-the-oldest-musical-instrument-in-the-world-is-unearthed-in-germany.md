##### Flute
#  A flute carved over 35,000 years ago, and thought to be the oldest musical instrument in the world, is unearthed in Germany. 

Archaeologists said a bone flute and two fragments of ivory flutes discovered last fall represent the earliest known flowering of music-making in Stone Age culture.
