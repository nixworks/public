#  Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi tells a rally in Milan about his encounters with President of the United States Barack Obama, saying: "What's his name? Some tanned guy... Ah, Barack Obama!", also commenting on his wife Michelle: "You won't believe it, but two of them went to the beach because the wife is also tanned". 

Silvio Berlusconi, Italy&#039;s gaffe-prone prime minister, has again referred to US President Barack Obama as &#034;suntanned&#034;, days after being snubbed by Michelle Obama at the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh.
