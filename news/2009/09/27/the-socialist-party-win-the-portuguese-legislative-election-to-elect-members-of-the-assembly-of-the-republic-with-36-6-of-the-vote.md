##### Socialist Party
#  The Socialist Party win the Portuguese legislative election to elect members of the Assembly of the Republic, with 36.6% of the vote. 

With unemployment at its highest level in 20 years, Portugal went to the polls yesterday in an election that could bring greater political uncertainty as the ruling Socialists are expected to win but fall short of an absolute majority.
