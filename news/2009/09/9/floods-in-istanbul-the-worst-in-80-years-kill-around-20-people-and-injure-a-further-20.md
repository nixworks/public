##### Floods
#  Floods in Istanbul, the worst in 80 years, kill around 20 people and injure a further 20. 

Flash floods killed 31 people in northwest Turkey, sweeping through the city of Istanbul, swamping houses, turning highways into fast-flowing rivers and drowning seven women in a minibus that was taking them to work.
