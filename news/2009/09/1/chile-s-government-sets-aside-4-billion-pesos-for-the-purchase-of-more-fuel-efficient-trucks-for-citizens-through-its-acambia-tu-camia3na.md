#  Chile's government sets aside 4 billion pesos for the purchase of more fuel-efficient trucks for citizens through its "Cambia tu Camion" ("Change your Truck") program. 

The Chilean government will subsidize the purchase of more fuel-efficient trucks for citizens through a program set to start later this year. The program, called &ldquo;Cambia tu Cami&oacute;n,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Change your Truck,&rdquo; will offer a bonus of 4, 8 or 12 million pesos (7.200, 14.500 or 21.700 US dollars respectively), toward the purchase of a new, more fuel efficient car, with the trade-in of a truck over 25 years old.
