#  China announces it will reduce its use of the death penalty for all but the most serious crimes. 

China will cut the number of people it executes every year to &quot;an extremely small number&quot; and commute more death sentences, though the country has no plans to abolish capital punishment, a state newspaper said on Wednesday.
