#  United States President Barack Obama halts the trials of detainees at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base's detention camp. 

Hours after taking office, U.S. President Barack Obama ordered military prosecutors in the Guantanamo war crimes tribunals to ask for a 120-day halt in all pending cases and a judge granted the request on Wednesday in the case against a young Canadian.
