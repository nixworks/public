##### Van Morrison
#  Van Morrison tells "RTE News at One" that a baby his own website claimed he has fathered does not exist and that he has never met the alleged mother. 

Van Morrison has exclusively told RTÉ Radio&#39;s News at One that his official website was hacked and a &#39;statement&#39; on it about him fathering a child with his manager is completely untrue and &#39;utterly without foundation&#39;.
