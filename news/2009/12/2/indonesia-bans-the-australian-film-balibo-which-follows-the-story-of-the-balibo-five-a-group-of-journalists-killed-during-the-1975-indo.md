#  Indonesia bans the Australian film "Balibo", which follows the story of the Balibo Five, a group of journalists killed during the 1975 Indonesian invasion of East Timor. 

The Jakarta Foreign Correspondents Club (JFCC) decided to &quot;err on the side of caution&quot; in canceling a private screening Tuesday of Balibo, a movie about the death of five Australian journalists in the then East Timor in 1975, said JFCC president Jason Tedjasukman
