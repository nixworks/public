#  Brazil's former Environment minister Marina Silva joins the Green Party which wants to field her as a black female candidate for the 2010 Brazilian presidential race when President Lula's two terms comes to an end. 

&ldquo;During the US Democrat party primaries, when Hillary Clinton was running against Barack Obama, a friend of mine said the US would have to choose between a woman and a black person, but if I was to be presidential candidate in Brazil, we wouldn&rsquo;t have that problem, because I&rsquo;m a woman and black&rdquo;.
