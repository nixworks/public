#  A mysterious deposit of cosmic dust is discovered inside the Red Rectangle Nebula. 

The universe is not empty. The space between stars and between galaxies is permeated by gas and dust. In fact our solar system is currently experiencing a cosmic dust storm with at least three times as much dust passing through compared to just a few years ago, owing to a periodic weakening of the sun&#39;s magnetic field. And sometime in the next 10,000 years, we&#39;ll plow through the G-cloud, a region of dust more dense than the one we&#39;re in now.
