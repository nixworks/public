#  California will lay off 20,000 government workers, due to the State Legislature's failure to pass a budget. 

California, which is on the brink of running out of cash, will notify 20,000 state workers on Tuesday their jobs may be eliminated, a spokesman for Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said on Monday.
