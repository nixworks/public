##### House of Lords
#  In an appearance before the House of Lords Communications Select Committee, BBC Director-General Mark Thompson denies that the appearance of British National Party leader Nick Griffin on "Question Time" was a bid for ratings. 

The BNP could be invited on to Question Time up to once a year, according to the head of the BBC.
