##### Yevgeny Dzhugashvili
#  Yevgeny Dzhugashvili launches a court action claiming the "Novaya Gazeta" newspaper has defamed his grandfather, Joseph Stalin. 

Hearings began today in a libel case brought by the grandson of Joseph Stalin against a prominent Russian newspaper. Yevgeny Dzhugashvili, the Soviet dictatorâ€™s grandson, took offence at an article published by the liberal paper Novaya Gazeta that accused Stalin of personally signing death warrants for thousands of people.
