#  U.S.-based rights group Human Rights Watch accuses Chinese authorities of running illegal "black jails" where Chinese citizens are detained for bringing up local complaints. 

They travel thousands of miles to Beijing to bring their problems – land-grabbing, bullying, eviction or abuse by local officials – to the government&#039;s attention. But instead of obtaining justice, a shocking new report reveals that many are thrown into sordid and illegal &quot;black jails&quot; where they may be abused, beaten, tortured, raped, robbed, and deprived of food, sleep and medical care.
