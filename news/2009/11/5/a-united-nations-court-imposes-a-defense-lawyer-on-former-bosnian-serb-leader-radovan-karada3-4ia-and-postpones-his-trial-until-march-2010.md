##### United Nations
#  A United Nations court imposes a defense lawyer on former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, and postpones his trial until March 2010. 

Radovan Karadzic will have a defence lawyer imposed on him after United Nations judges ruled that he had &#039;substantially and persistently obstructed&#039; his trial for genocide and war crimes.
