#  Officials investigate a radiation leak at the Kaiga nuclear plant in southern India which left 55 employees requiring medical treatment. 

Indian officials are investigating the leak of a radioactive substance into drinking water at an atomic power plant in the south of the country, they said on Sunday. Local police have been asked to help probe how tritium seeped into a water cooler, after which 55 workers underwent medical treatment for excessive exposure to radiation. Officials at the highly protected plant in Kaiga on the west coast, 450 km (280 miles) from Bangalore, said the leak may have been deliberate. &quot;Mischief is not ruled out. Investigations are on,&quot; the director of the plant, J.P. Gupta, told Reuters. The 55 workers were back at the plant, Gupta added. &quot;This incident has (in) no way affected (the) public, safety, health and environment.&quot; (Reporting by Habib Beary; Editing by Matthias Williams) ((matthias.williams@thomsonreuters.com; Reuters Messaging: matthias.williams.reuters.com@reuters.net, +91-997-111-0254)) ((If you have a query or comment on this story, send an email to news.feedback.asia@thomsonreuters.com))
