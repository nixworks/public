##### Buenos Aires
#  A court in Buenos Aires declares Argentinean law restricting marriage to a man and a woman unconstitutional, allowing a same-sex couple to marry; the city government announces it will not appeal. 

An Argentine judge has granted a homosexual couple permission to get married, setting a precedent that could pave the way for the Catholic country to become the first in Latin America to allow same-sex marriage.
