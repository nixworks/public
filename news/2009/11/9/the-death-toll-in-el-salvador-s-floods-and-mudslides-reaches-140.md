#  The death toll in El Salvador's floods and mudslides reaches 140. 

The death toll from flooding and mudslides in El Salvador triggered by the passage of Hurricane Ida jumped to 124 people, Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes said in a national radio broadcast. Funes described the disaster as &quot;a tragedy&quot; and said the damage sustained by the Central American country was &quot;incalculable.&quot; (Reporting by Nelson Renteria; Writing by Robert Campbell, editing by Philip Barbara)
