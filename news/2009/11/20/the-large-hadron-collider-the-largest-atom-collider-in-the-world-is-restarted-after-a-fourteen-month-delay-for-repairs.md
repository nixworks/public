##### Large Hadron Collider
#  The Large Hadron Collider, the largest atom collider in the world, is restarted after a fourteen-month delay for repairs. 

Scientists are restarting a giant sub-atomic particle collider built to reproduce &quot;Big Bang&quot; conditions, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) said on Friday.
