#  Italians reject the modification of their constitution. In a two-day referendum, "No" beats "Yes" approximately 61% to 38%, thus keeping the text unchanged. The Northern League had announced its withdrawal from the centre-right opposition coalition if reform was defeated. Votes of Italians living abroad are still to be counted.
