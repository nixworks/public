##### Saddam Hussein
#  Saddam Hussein has ended a brief hunger strike, after missing one meal in his prison. He did this in protest of the killing of one of his lawyers. 

Saddam Hussein thinks that the United States will have to seek his help to quell the insurgency in Iraq and open the way for U.S. forces to withdraw, his chief lawyer said Sunday.
