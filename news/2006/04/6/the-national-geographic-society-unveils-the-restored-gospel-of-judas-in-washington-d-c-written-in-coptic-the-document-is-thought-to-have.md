#  The National Geographic Society unveils the restored Gospel of Judas in Washington, D.C. Written in Coptic, the document is thought to have come from the 2nd century. It had been deteriorating rapidly when found. 

Researchers say they have discovered the only known copy of the Gospel of Judas, which portrays Judas Iscariot not as a traitor, but as an essential player in helping Jesus carry out his mission. Alex Chadwick talks to Herb Krosney, author of The Lost Gospel.
