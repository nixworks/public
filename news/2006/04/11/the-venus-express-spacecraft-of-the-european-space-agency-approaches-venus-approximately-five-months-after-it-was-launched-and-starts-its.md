##### Venus Express
#  The "Venus Express" spacecraft of the European Space Agency approaches Venus approximately five months after it was launched and starts its main engine burn to slow itself down and allow the capture into orbit around Venus. 

 At 09:17 CEST today, Venus Express started its main engine burn. The burn, to last 50 minutes, will slow down the spacecraft and allow the capture into orbit around Venus. The main engine burn started a few minutes after the firing of the spacecraft thrusters, to make sure the propellant&#8230;
