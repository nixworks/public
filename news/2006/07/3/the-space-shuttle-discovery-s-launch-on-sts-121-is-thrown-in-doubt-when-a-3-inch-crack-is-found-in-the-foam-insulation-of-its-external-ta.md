#  The Space Shuttle "Discovery"'s launch on STS-121 is thrown in doubt when a 3 inch crack is found in the foam insulation of its external tank. Despite the crack, NASA decides to proceed with the launch, scheduled for 2:38 PM ET Tuesday, which would be the first manned launch on the United States Independence Day. 

NASA loads the shuttle Discovery&#39;s external tank with rocket fuel in preparation for what could be the space agency&#39;s first Fourth of July shuttle launch.
