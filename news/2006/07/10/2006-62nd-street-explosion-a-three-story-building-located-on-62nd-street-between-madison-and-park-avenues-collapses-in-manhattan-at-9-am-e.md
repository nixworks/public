##### 2006 62nd Street explosion
#  2006 62nd Street explosion: A three-story building located on 62nd Street between Madison and Park avenues collapses in Manhattan at 9 AM EDT following an explosion, and then followed by flames erupting in the building. FDNY labels it a "major incident." 

Authorities were investigating whether a doctor who survived the explosion of a four-story home on Manhattan&#8217;s Upper East Side might have caused the blast rather than sell the home as part of a divorce judgment in his ex-wife&#8217;s favor.
