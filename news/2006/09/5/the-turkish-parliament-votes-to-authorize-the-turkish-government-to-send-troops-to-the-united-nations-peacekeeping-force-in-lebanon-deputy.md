#  The Turkish Parliament votes to authorize the Turkish government to send troops to the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon. Deputy speaker Nevzat Pakdil said 340 of the 533 lawmakers present in the 550-seat house voted for the deployment; 192 voted against and one abstained. 

Lebanese troops moved on Tuesday into a town wrecked by Israel&#8217;s war with Hezbollah, as U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he hoped for word on the lifting of an Israeli blockade on Lebanon within two days.
