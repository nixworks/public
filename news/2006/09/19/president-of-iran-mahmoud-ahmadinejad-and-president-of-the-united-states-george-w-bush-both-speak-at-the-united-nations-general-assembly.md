#  President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and President of the United States George W. Bush both speak at the United Nations General Assembly. Ahmadinejad said that Bush's policies in the Middle East were "moving the world toward war." Bush said that "The greatest obstacle to this future is that your (Iranian) rulers have chosen to deny you (the Iranian people) liberty and to use your nation's resources to fund terrorism and fuel extremism and pursue nuclear weapons." 

President Bush&#8217;s policies in the Middle East are &#8220;moving the world toward war,&#8221; Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Tuesday in an exclusive interview with &#8220;NBC Nightly News&#8221; anchor Brian Williams.
