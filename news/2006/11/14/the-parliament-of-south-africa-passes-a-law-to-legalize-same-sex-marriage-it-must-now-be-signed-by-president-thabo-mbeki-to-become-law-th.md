##### South African Parliament
#  The Parliament of South Africa passes a law to legalize same-sex marriage. It must now be signed by President Thabo Mbeki to become law. The change was required by a constitutional court, which ruled last year that the current marriage law unconstitutionally discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation.
