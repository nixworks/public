#  The European Union has renewed diplomatic sanctions for Uzbekistan. The sanctions, which have been violated repeatedly by the governments of Britain and Germany, prohibit the sale of weapons to the Uzbek government and visits from EU officials to Uzbekistan or vice versa. The sanctions were originally implemented after the Uzbek government would not allow an international investigation into the terrorist uprising in Andijan.
