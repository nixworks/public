#  A meeting between the President of the United States George W. Bush and the Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki in Jordan is cancelled. A classified Bush administration memo critical of the ability of al-Maliki to bring sectarian conflict under control had previously been published in "The New York Times". In a later meeting, they decided that Iraq should not be divided into semi-autonomous zones.
