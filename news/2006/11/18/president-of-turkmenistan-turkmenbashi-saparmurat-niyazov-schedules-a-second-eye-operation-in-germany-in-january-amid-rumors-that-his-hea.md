#  President of Turkmenistan "Turkmenbashi" Saparmurat Niyazov schedules a second eye operation in Germany in January amid rumors that his health is poor. President Niyazov cannot be operated on in Turkmenistan because earlier this year he signed a decree that closed all hospitals outside of Ashgabat and replaced most healthcare staff with soldiers.
