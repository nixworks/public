##### His Majesty's Government
#  The British government rejects proposals to increase the length of sound recording's copyright protection from 50 years to 95 years. This means that Sir Cliff Richard's earliest songs will come out of copyright in 2008, and the earliest songs recorded by the Beatles in 2013. Songs composed and-or written will still have copyright for 70 years after the author's death.
