#  Rwanda breaks off diplomatic relations with France after a French judge, Jean-Louis Bruguire, issues warrants for the arrest of President of Rwanda Paul Kagame and nine associates for their alleged involvement in the shooting down of a plane carrying former President Juvenal Habyarimana. The incident sparked the Rwandan Genocide in 1994.
