#  Fierce political rioting in Bangladesh kills at least 10 people and wounds about 500 as the main political parties fail to agree on a successor after the expiry of Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia's five-year term. President Iajuddin Ahmed becomes interim PM. Opposition Awami League accuses Iajuddin of violating the Constitution of Bangladesh by appointing himself as head of the interim government.
