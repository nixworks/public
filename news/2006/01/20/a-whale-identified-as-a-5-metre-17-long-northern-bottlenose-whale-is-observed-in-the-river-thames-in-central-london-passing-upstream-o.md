#  A whale, identified as a 5 metre (17') long Northern Bottlenose whale, is observed in the River Thames in Central London passing upstream of the Houses of Parliament. The "River Thames whale" is believed to have passed through the Thames Barrier about 1515 UTC on Thursday afternoon. Attempts are being made to guide it back to the Thames estuary, where a second whale has been sighted off Southend on Sea.
