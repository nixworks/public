In April 2009, a three-judge panel had sentenced Fujimori for acts of corruption, human rights violations, and various others crimes. Fujimori, who has been in jail since 2007 and whose health has deteriorated, including alleged tongue cancer, has applied for a pardon unsuccessfully on two occasions. ](/news/2017/10/11/the-peruvian-pedro-pablo-kuczynski-administration-through-the-ministry-of-justice-appoints-a-new-head-to-the-direction-of-presidential-gra.md) _Context: 2007_
