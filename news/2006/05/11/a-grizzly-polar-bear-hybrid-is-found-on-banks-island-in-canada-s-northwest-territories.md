##### Grizzly-polar bear hybrid
#  A grizzly-polar bear hybrid is found on Banks Island in Canada's Northwest Territories. 

DNA tests confirmed that a bear bagged by a hunter in Canada&#39;s Northwest Territory is half grizzly and half polar bear, a mix that some experts had never expected to find in the wild.
