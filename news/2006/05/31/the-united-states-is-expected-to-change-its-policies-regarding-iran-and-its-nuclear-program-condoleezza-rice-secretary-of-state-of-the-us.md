#  The United States is expected to change its policies regarding Iran and its nuclear program. Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State of the USA said that the USA may join Iran nuclear talks. 

Iran&#39;s top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Sunday that energy supplies from the Gulf region would be disrupted if Iran came under attack from the United States and insisted his country would not give up the right to produce nuclear fuel.
