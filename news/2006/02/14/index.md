##### Mahmoud Abbas
### [ The "New York Times" reveals the existence of a "destabilization plan" for Hamas, winner of the Palestinian legislative elections. The intention is, according to Israeli officials and Western diplomats, to make sure that Hamas officials fail in fulfilling their campaign promises so that the president, Mahmoud Abbas, is forced to call a new election. The plan would cut all Quartet funds from the Palestinian National Authority (PA), while Israel would refuse to release taxes and custom duties it collects on behalf of the PA and also block movements between the West Bank and the Gaza strip. A third of the Palestinian population would suffer from the Quartet's decision to cut funds to the PA. ](/news/2006/02/14/the-new-york-times-reveals-the-existence-of-a-destabilization-plan-for-hamas-winner-of-the-palestinian-legislative-elections-the-inte.md)
