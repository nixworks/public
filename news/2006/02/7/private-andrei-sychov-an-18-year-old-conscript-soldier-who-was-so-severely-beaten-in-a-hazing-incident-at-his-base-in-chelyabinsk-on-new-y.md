##### Andrei Sychov
#  Private Andrei Sychov, an 18-year-old conscript soldier who was so severely beaten in a hazing incident at his base in Chelyabinsk on New Year's Eve that his legs and genitals had to be amputated, is transferred to Moscow for further treatment. The incident has caused uproar in Russia with President Putin addressing the State Duma on army bullying. Sixteen soldiers officially died in hazing incidents last year, although the figure does not include related suicides.
