#  NASA announces the unusual gamma ray burst GRB 060218 that is not yet explained and may be a predecessor to a supernova. It was located 440 million light-years away and lasted for 33 minutes, closer and longer than any previous gamma ray burst. 

Astronomers have detected a new type of cosmic outburst that they can&#039;t yet explain. The event was very nearby, they said.
