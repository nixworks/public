#  Bangladesh hangs six people convicted of killing two judges during a wave of terrorist attacks including the founder of the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, Shaykh Abdur Rahman, and his deputy Siddiqul Islam. The convicted men stated they had sought to kill the judges because the judiciary was run by secular rather than Sharia law.
