##### The Boeing Company
# The Boeing Company unveils its newest airplane, the Boeing 787 "Dreamliner" at its facility in Everett, Washington, USA. The 787 is an alternative to Airbus's A350. 

For a few, high-profile hours on Sunday, Boeing&#8217;s new 787 Dreamliner captured the world&#8217;s attention as it was unveiled during a multimedia extravaganza. But there is still a lot of work to be done. Boeing is under tremendous pressure to get its airplane ready for first flight in late August.
