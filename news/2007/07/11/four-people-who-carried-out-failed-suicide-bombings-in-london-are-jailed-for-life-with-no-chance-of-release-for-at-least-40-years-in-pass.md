##### 21 July 2005 London bombings
#  Four people who carried out failed suicide bombings in London are jailed for life, with no chance of release for at least 40 years. In passing the sentence, the judge ruled that the plot was "part of an al-Qaida inspired and controlled sequence of attacks", although the British government has always claimed the attacks were "home grown", and not connected to al-Qaida.
