#  Boston transit officials and the U.S. Coast Guard shut down parts of Interstate 93, two bridges, and a section of the Charles River after the discovery of suspicious devices placed around the city. Turner Broadcasting released a statement that the items were marketing tools placed within ten U.S. cities for the cartoon "Aqua Teen Hunger Force". One arrest was made Wednesday. 

The discovery of the devices temporarily closed parts of bridges, subway stations, an Interstate highway and even part of the Charles River in Boston.
