##### Kazakhstan political shakeup of 2007
#  Kazakhstan political shakeup of 2007: Foreign Minister Kassym-Jomart Tokayev is appointed Chairman of the Senate of Kazakhstan. If aging President Nursultan Nazarbayev dies, according to the Constitution, Tokayev would become President. Some analysts say this is a sign that Tokayev, and not one of Nazarbayev's politically active daughters, is his desired successor.
