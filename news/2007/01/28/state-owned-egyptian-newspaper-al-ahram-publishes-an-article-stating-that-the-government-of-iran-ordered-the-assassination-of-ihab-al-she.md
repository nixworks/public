##### Egypt
#  State-owned Egyptian newspaper "Al Ahram" publishes an article stating that the Government of Iran ordered the assassination of Ihab al-Sherif, Egypt's ambassador to Iraq, in July 2005 in an effort to limit Egypt's influence in the region. 

Attributed to anonymous sources and denied by the foreign ministries of both Egypt and Iran, the report could strain already tense relations between the countries.
