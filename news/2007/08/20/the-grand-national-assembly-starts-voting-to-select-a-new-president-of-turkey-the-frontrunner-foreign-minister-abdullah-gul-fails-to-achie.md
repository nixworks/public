#  The Grand National Assembly starts voting to select a new President of Turkey. The frontrunner Foreign Minister Abdullah Gl fails to achieve a necessary two-thirds majority in the first round with 341 out of 550 but is highly likely to be elected in later rounds when a simple majority of 50 per cent is required. 

The frontrunner to be Turkey&#039;s next president, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, has failed to secure election in a first round parliamentary vote, but remained virtually assured of victory in a later ballot.
