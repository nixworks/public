##### National People's Congress
#  A report from the National People's Congress environment and resources protection committee finds that high levels of pollution in the Huai River and its tributaries poses a "threat to the water safety of one sixth of the country's 1.3 billion population". 

Polluters along two of China&#039;s main rivers have defied years of clean-up efforts, leaving much of the water unfit to touch, let alone drink.
