The species' genetic and anatomical distinctiveness (identification) has been determined in a study made the following three years. Its scientific name is "Cercopithecus lomamiensis". The publication already recommends it to the Red List of endangered species and proposes conservation measures for its Lomami and central Congo Basin habitat. ](/news/2012/09/12/a-new-species-of-guenon-monkey-discovered-in-2007-is-now-identified-in-opala-dr-congo-local-inhabitants-call-it-lesula-the-first-specim.md) _Context: endangered species_
