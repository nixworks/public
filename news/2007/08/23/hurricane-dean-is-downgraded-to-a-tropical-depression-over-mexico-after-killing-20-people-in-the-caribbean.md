##### Hurricane Dean
#  Hurricane Dean is downgraded to a tropical depression over Mexico after killing 20 people in the Caribbean. 

The remnants of Hurricane Dean dumped heavy rain across central Mexico on Thursday, drenching mudslide-prone mountains as it pushed inland after slamming into the Gulf Coast as a Category 2 storm and killing four people.
