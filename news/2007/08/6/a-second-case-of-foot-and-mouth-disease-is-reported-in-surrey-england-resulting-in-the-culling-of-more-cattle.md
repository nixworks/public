##### Outbreak of 2007
#  A second case of foot and mouth disease is reported in Surrey, England, resulting in the culling of more cattle. 

Britain&#039;s chief vet says another suspected case of foot and mouth disease has been reported near the site of the original outbreak and a new cull of about 50 cattle has therefore been ordered.
