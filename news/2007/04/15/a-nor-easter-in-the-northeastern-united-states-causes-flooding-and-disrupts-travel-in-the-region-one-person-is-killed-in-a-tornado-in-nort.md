#  A nor'easter in the northeastern United States causes flooding and disrupts travel in the region. One person is killed in a tornado in North Carolina and two people die in weather-related car accidents in New York and Connecticut. 

A rare spring northeaster flooded shorelines and rivers, disrupted travel and washed out plans for millions.
