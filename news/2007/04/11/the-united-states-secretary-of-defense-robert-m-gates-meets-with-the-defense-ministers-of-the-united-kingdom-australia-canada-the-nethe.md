##### United States Secretary of Defense
#  The United States Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates meets with the Defense Ministers of the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Denmark as well as officials from Estonia and Romania to discuss progress in Afghanistan in expectation of a Taliban offensive. Two Canadian soldiers are killed when a roadside bomb explodes. 

Critics of the Bush administration say that the focus on the Iraq war has jeopardized the early military victory in Afghanistan in 2001.
