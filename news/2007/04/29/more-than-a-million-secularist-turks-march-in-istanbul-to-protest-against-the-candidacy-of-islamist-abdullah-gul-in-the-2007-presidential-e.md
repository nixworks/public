#  More than a million secularist Turks march in Istanbul to protest against the candidacy of Islamist Abdullah Gl in the 2007 presidential election. 

As many as one million people rallied in a sea of red Turkish flags in Istanbul on Sunday, accusing the government of planning an Islamist state and demanding it withdraw its presidential candidate.
