#  The United States Central Intelligence Agency admits to destroying at least two videotapes documenting the interrogation of two al-Qaeda operatives in custody following Congressional scrutiny. 

The C.I.A. destroyed videotapes in 2005 amid scrutiny about its secret detention program, according to government officials, raising questions about whether C.I.A. officials withheld information from the courts and the Sept. 11 commission.
