#  2007 Pakistani state of emergency: Backed by hundreds of police officers, the Pakistani government again placed former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto under house arrest to prevent a protest against President Pervez Musharraf. 

Benazir Bhutto faces a seven-day detention order if she presses ahead with a planned opposition march.
