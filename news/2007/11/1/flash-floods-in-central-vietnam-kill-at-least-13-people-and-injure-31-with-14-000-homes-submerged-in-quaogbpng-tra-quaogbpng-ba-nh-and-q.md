#  Flash floods in central Vietnam kill at least 13 people and injure 31 with 14,000 homes submerged in QuGBPng Tri, QuGBPng Binh and QuGBPng Nam provinces. 

Flash floods killed at least 13 people and injured 31 in central Vietnam this week and more heavy rain over the next few days could add to the damage, the government said on Thursday. About 14,000 homes were submerged in Quang Tri, Quang Binh, Quang Nam provinces, it said. A tropical pressure system made land in central Vietnam on Tuesday, dumping heavy up to 465 mm (18 inches) of rain on several coastal provinces and raised river levels, government weather forecasters said. The heavy rain would continue on Thursday and Friday, raising the risk of more serious floods in the central provinces from Nghe An to Quang Ngai, they said.
