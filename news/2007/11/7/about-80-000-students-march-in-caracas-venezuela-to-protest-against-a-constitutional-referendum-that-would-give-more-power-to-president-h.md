#  About 80,000 students march in Caracas, Venezuela, to protest against a constitutional referendum that would give more power to President Hugo Chvez. Nine students are injured by riot controllers at the Central University of Venezuela. 

A leader of the nascent Venezuelan student movement protesting President Hugo Chávez’s expanding power described it as the most cohesive challenge to Mr. Chávez’s government.
