##### U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
#  The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rules 2-1 to uphold an act of the 109th Congress removing the right of Guantanamo Bay detainees to challenge their detention in lower federal courts. The Military Commissions Act suspends the right to "habeas corpus" and bars anyone deemed an "enemy combatant" access to the federal courts.
