##### Mission Accomplished
#  On the fourth anniversary of his "Mission Accomplished" speech, President George W. Bush, citing the provisions setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, vetoes an Iraq War funding measure that also improves resting, training and equipping standards for combat troops before their deployment, and sets binding benchmarks for the Iraqi government. 

The president rejects legislation to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq, calling it &quot;a prescription for chaos.&quot;
