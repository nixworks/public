#  NASA announces that the Chandra X-ray Observatory and ground-based telescopes have discovered a massive supernova designated SN 2006gy, the largest ever recorded, and possibly a new type that has been predicted but never observed. 

The newly detected â€˜kingâ€™ of supernovas might be evidence of a new way massive stars die.
