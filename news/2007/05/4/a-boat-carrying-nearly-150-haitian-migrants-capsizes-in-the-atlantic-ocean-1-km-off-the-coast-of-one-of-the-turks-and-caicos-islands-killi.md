#  A boat carrying nearly 150 Haitian migrants capsizes in the Atlantic Ocean 1 km off the coast of one of the Turks and Caicos Islands, killing at least twenty, requiring the rescue of at least seventy-three and leaving at least fifty-eight unaccounted for. 

At least 20 people are dead and dozens are still missing Friday after a boat loaded with Haitian migrants capsized in the Atlantic Ocean southeast of the Bahamas.
