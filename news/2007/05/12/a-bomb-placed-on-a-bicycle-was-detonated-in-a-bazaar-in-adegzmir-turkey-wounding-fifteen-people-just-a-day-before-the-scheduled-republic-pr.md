#  A bomb placed on a bicycle was detonated in a bazaar in Izmir, Turkey wounding fifteen people just a day before the scheduled "republic protest" in the city. One of the wounded was in a critical condition and later died in the hospital while most of the others were lightly wounded and were released from the hospital the same day.
