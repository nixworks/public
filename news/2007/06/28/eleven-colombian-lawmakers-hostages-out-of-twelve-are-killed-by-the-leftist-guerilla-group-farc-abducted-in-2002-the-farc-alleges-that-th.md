#  Eleven Colombian lawmakers hostages out of twelve are killed by the leftist guerilla group FARC. Abducted in 2002, the FARC alleges that the hostages died in a crossfire when an unidentified military group attacked. The FARC blames the Colombian government, but the government says they knew nothing of the location or of any attempt of rescue.
