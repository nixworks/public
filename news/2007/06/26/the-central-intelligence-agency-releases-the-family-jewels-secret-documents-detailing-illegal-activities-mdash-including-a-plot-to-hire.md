#  The Central Intelligence Agency releases the "family jewels," secret documents detailing illegal activities&mdash;including a plot to hire members of the Mafia to assassinate Fidel Castro&mdash;and domestic spying. 

The CIA worked with three American mobsters in a botched &quot;gangster-type&quot; attempt to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro in the early 1960s, according to documents released by the CIA on Tuesday.
