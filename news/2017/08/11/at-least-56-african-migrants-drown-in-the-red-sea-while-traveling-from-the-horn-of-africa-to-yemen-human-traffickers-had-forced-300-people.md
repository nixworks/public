##### Migrant crisis
# At least 56 African migrants drown in the Red Sea while traveling from the Horn of Africa to Yemen. Human traffickers had forced 300 people aboard two boats into the sea. 

At least 56 people have drowned over the past 24 hours, and dozens remain missing, after human traffickers forced 300 African migrants off two Yemen-bound boats and into the sea. Survivors -- all Ethiopian and Somali migrants -- managed to make their way to Shabwa, a southern province along Yemen&#x27;
