# A magnitude 6.4 earthquake occurs off the Indonesian island of Sumatra. There are no reports of casualties or structural damage to buildings. 

SINGAPORE: An earthquake of magnitude 6.5 struck west of Indonesia&#039;s island of Sumatra on Sunday (Aug 13), the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage in the quake, which hit at a depth of 67km, at a distance of 81km west of the city of Bengkulu. &#034;The earthquake was quite strong and shallow, it was felt all the way to Padang, West Sumatra, but there was no threat of a tsunami,&#034; Mochammad Riyadi, an official at Indonesia&#039;s meteorology and geophysics agency told AFP. He said officials were checking if there were any casualties or damage. Bengkulu resident Neng Hasnah said the quake felt very strong for a few seconds, forcing her and her family members to flee her house. &#034;I was carrying my seven-month old granddaughter and I had to run, all the neighbours also ran outside their homes,&#034; Hasnah told AFP. TREMORS FELT IN SINGAPORE Channel NewsAsia received calls from residents in Singapore living in Toa Payoh and Farrer Road saying they felt tremors. &#034;Tremors felt in Lor 1 Toa Payoh at around 11.10am,&#034; said Andrew Tan after contacting Channel NewsAsia via WhatsApp. Some took to twitter wondering if the tremors were a result of an earthquake in the region. https://twitter.com/dogmacatmamagma/status/896570356680359937 https://twitter.com/rohitdadwal/status/896572452968341506 Twitter user Pieterldenburg posted a video of a ceiling lamp swaying: https://twitter.com/MRPIE314/status/896570511127224320 Indonesia sits on the Pacific &#034;Ring of Fire&#034; where tectonic plates collide, causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity.
