##### Immigration policy of Donald Trump
# United States President Donald Trump, together with Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, unveils the RAISE Act, a plan that would, if passed, reduce legal immigration to the U.S. by half each year, and implement a "merit-based system" prioritizing skilled workers, instead of the current family-based chain migration system. 

The bill is expected to face fierce resistance from congressional Democrats and immigrant rights groups.
