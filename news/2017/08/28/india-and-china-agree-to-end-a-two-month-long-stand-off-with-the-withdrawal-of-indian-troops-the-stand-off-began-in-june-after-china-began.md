##### 2017 China-India border standoff
# India and China agree to end a two month-long stand-off with the withdrawal of Indian troops. The stand-off began in June after China began constructing a road in the disputed territory of Doklam which is claimed by both China and Bhutan. 

India and China have agreed to end a months-long military stand-off at a disputed border area in the Himalayas, with Indian troops already beginning to pull out, officials say.
