##### Unite the Right rally
# During a press conference at Trump Tower in New York City, which was intended to announce an executive order on infrastructure policy, President Donald Trump defended his August 12 remarks about the Charlottesville rally, placing "blame on both sides" for the incidents at the rally and criticizing what he referred to as the "alt-left," equating them with white supremacists and neo-Nazis on the right. 

President Trump told reporters the counter-protesters demonstrating against white nationalists are also to blame for violence in Charlottesville Saturday.
