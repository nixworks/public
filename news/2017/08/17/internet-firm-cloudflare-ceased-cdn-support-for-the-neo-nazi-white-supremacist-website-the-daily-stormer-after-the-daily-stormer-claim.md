##### Unite the Right rally
# Internet firm CloudFlare ceased CDN support for the neo-Nazi, white supremacist website "The Daily Stormer", after The "Daily Stormer" claimed that the company supported their cause. "The Daily Stormer" website had already lost web-hosting services by the domain register GoDaddy and Google 

Cloudflare said claims that it secretly supported The Daily Stormer site were the last straw.
