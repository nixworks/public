##### 2017 Dubai skyscraper fire
# A fire at the 79-story Dubai Torch Tower in the United Arab Emirates, which forced nighttime evacuations, was under control in a few hours with no serious injuries immediately reported. The building's exterior was still being renovated from a fire in February, 2015, which investigators had blamed, at least in part, to flammable siding, echoing the findings of this past June's Grenfell Tower fire in London. 

The blaze started soon after midnight and spread across dozens of floors in one of the worldâ€™s tallest buildings, but the authorities said everyone made it out safely.
