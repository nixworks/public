##### Battle of Marawi
# The Pentagon is considering conducting airstrikes in Marawi, which if approved would later put U.S. troops on the ground to battle the ISIS-affiliated Maute group as well as related Islamist terror groups. A spokesperson later denied the claims as well as clarified that the Philippines has yet to make a request. 

The strikes would likely be conducted by drones, and would be part of an official military operation that may be named as early as Tuesday.
