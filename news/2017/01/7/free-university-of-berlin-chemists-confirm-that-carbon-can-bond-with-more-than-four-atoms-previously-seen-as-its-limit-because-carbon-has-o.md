# Free University of Berlin chemists confirm that carbon can bond with more than four atoms, previously seen as its limit because carbon has only four shareable electrons. The researchers used X-rays to, for the first time, map the molecule -- a carbon atom bonded to six other carbon atoms. 

This molecule doesn&#039;t play by the rules.
