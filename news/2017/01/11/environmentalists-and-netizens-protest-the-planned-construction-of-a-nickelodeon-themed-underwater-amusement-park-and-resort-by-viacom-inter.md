# Environmentalists and netizens protest the planned construction of a Nickelodeon-themed underwater amusement park and resort by Viacom International Media Networks in Coron, Palawan, Philippines, despite claims by Viacom that the project would advocate marine resources conservation. 

Environmental groups say a large underwater theme park in Palawan would destroy its marine ecosystem.
