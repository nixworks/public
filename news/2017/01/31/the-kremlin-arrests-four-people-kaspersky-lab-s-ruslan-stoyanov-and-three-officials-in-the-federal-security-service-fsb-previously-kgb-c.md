# The Kremlin arrests four people, Kaspersky Lab's Ruslan Stoyanov, and three officials in the Federal Security Service (FSB previously KGB) Center for Information Security, reportedly on treason charges for passing information to America's CIA. 

Russian media reported the arrests this week of three individuals suspected of treason, including a researcher employed by the nation&#8217;s leading cybersecurity firm and two employees of the former KGB.
