##### Tel Aviv
# In Tel Aviv, up to 20,000 people demonstrate in front of the home of the Attorney General of Israel, Avichai Mandelblit, against the slow pace of corruption investigations against Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu. 

Netanyahu and his family are suspected of accepting expensive gifts in return for political favors for several wealthy donors, including the Hollywood producer and media magnate Arnon Milchan.
