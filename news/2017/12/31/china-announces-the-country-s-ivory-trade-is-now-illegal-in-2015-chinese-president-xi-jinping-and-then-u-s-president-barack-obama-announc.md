# China announces the country's ivory trade is now illegal. In 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping and then-U.S. President Barack Obama announced "near-complete" ivory bans for each country. America's ivory ban went into effect in June 2016. 

All of Chinaâ€™s government-licensed carving factories and ivory retailers are about to close, following a joint pledge with the U.S. in 2015.
