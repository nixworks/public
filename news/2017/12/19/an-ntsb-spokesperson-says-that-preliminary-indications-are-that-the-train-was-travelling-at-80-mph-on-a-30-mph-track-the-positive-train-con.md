##### 2017 Washington train derailment
# An NTSB spokesperson says that preliminary indications are that the train was travelling at 80 mph on a 30 mph track. The Positive train control (PTC) safety system was not operational on the train, says Amtrak. 

Investigators focus on how fast the Amtrak train took a bend that had reduced speed warnings.
