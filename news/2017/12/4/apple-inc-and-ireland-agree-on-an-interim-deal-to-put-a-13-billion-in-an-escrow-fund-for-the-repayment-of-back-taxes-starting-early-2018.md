##### Investigation of Apple's transfer pricing arrangements with Ireland
# Apple Inc. and Ireland agree on an interim deal to put EUR13 billion in an escrow fund for the repayment of back taxes, starting early 2018. Still, both parties refute that the alleged "sweetheart" corporate tax deals were illegal. In 2016, the European Commission found that an unfair advantage of EUR13 billion is to be reimbursed. 

To keep EU regulators happy, Apple will begin paying unpaid taxes to Ireland, which will be saved into an escrow account.
