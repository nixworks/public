##### 2017 Spanish constitutional crisis
# The prosecutor in a Brussels court repeats the demand to extradite Carles Puigdemont and four other former Catalan officials to Spain. The defense says that the adduced facts are "not punishable" under Belgian law. The judge delays the decision until December 14. 

The Spanish Supreme Court decided to keep former Catalan Vice President Oriol Junqueras in jail, judging heâ€™s likely to challenge the authority of the state again if released.
