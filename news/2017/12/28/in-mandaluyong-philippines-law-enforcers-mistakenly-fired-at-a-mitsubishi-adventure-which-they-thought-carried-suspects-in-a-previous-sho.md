# In Mandaluyong, Philippines, law enforcers mistakenly fired at a Mitsubishi Adventure, which they thought carried suspects in a previous shooting incident, resulting in two people dead and two others injured. As a result, 10 police officers were relieved from the post. 

At least two people have died after law enforcers on Thursday night fired mistakenly shots at an AUV bringing a gunshot victim to the hospital.
