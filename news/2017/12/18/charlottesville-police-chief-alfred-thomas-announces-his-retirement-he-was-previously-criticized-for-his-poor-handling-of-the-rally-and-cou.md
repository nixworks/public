##### Unite the Right rally
# Charlottesville Police Chief Alfred Thomas announces his retirement. He was previously criticized for his poor handling of the rally and counterprotests. 

Accused by a stinging report of a &quot;slow-footed response&quot; to violence at the rally, and amid claims that he intimidated officers, Alfred Thomas is retiring. His deputy will take over as interim chief.
