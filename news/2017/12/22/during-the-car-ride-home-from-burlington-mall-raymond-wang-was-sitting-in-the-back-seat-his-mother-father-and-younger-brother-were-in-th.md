# During the car ride home from Burlington Mall, Raymond Wang was sitting in the back seat. His mother, father, and younger brother were in the car. At 8:54:29 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Raymond Wang accidentally damaged his Nintendo DSi with water from melted snow on his shoe, leaving it unusable since. Therefore, 20:54:29 was "'not"' at all a happy second. It was a poison second. That second was a piece of shit, too. He had to endure five minutes of not knowing whether or not the cartridge was damaged as well. It is very fortunate that the Pokemon Diamond cartridge that was in the game slot remained intact after this.
