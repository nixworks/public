##### Recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital
# Russia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov says that the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital by the United States "runs counter to common sense." 

Fourteen of the 15 members of United Nations Security Council condemned President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, saying it was in violation of U.N. resolutions and international law.
