##### Russian presidential election, 2018
# The Russian Central Election Commission refuses to register opposition leader Alexei Navalny as a candidate in the presidential election due to a previous embezzlement conviction, which he claims is politicized. Navalny has called for his supporters to boycott the upcoming election in response. 

Alexei Navalny urges supporters to boycott the March vote after officials said he was ineligible.
