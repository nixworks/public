# France's Constitutional Court rejects a bill to make visiting terrorist websites a criminal offence, citing "inviolability of freedom of communication and expression" as a reason. 

The issue of counter-terrorist measures is a highly debated topic in France, as in recent years the country has been hit by a number of terrorist attacks, with the deadliest one, in November 2015, claiming the lives of 130 people.
