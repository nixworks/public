##### Nepalese legislative election, 2017
# Voters in Nepal go to the polls for the second round of a historic legislative election. The turnout is 67%, up from 65% in the first round. 

When Nepalis head to the polls today for the first time since 1999, it will be hailed as a historic step forward—the start of a new democratic era for a country that has suffered from years of violence, instability, and government ineptitude. But hope for the future should not obscure the challenging legacies of the past.
