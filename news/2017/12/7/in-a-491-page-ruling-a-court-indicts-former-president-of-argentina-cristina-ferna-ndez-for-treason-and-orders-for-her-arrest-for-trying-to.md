##### AMIA bombing
# In a 491-page ruling, a court indicts former President of Argentina Cristina Fernandez for treason and orders for her arrest for "trying to cover up Iran's possible role in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center that killed 85 people". Former foreign affairs minister Hector Timerman is also concerned. Both have previously denied wrongdoing.
