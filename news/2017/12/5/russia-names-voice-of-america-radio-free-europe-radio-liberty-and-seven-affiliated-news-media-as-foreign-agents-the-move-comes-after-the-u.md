# Russia names Voice of America, Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty and seven affiliated news media as foreign agents. The move comes after the United States government ordered the Russian government-funded television network RT America to register as a foreign agent. 

The move comes in retaliation for U.S. actions against the RT news network.
