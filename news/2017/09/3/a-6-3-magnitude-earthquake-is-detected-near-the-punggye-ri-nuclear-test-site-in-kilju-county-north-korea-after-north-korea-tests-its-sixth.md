##### 2017 North Korea crisis
# A 6.3 magnitude earthquake is detected near the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site in Kilju County, North Korea, after North Korea tests its sixth and most powerful nuclear weapon to date. North Korean state media claims the country tested a hydrogen bomb that can be fitted on an ICBM. 

The test Sunday was an extraordinary show of defiance by the Northâ€™s leader, Kim Jong-un, against President Trump.
