##### Hurricane Harvey
# Hurricane Harvey is projected to possibly become the second costliest hurricane in the United States's history, with estimates ranging from US$72 billion to over $125 billion. In comparison, Hurricane Katrina's total damage is estimated to be around $118 to $160 billion. 

The cost to rebuild post-Hurricane Harvey is rising and already on track to shatter records.
