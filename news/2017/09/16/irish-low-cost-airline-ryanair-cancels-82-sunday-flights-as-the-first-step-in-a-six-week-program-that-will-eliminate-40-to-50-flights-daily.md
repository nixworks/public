# Irish low-cost airline Ryanair cancels 82 Sunday flights as the first step in a six-week program that will eliminate 40 to 50 flights daily to wipe out its crew vacation backlog in order to meet Irish Aviation Authority requirements by the end of this year. 

Ryanair Holdings Plc scrapped 82 flights on Sunday, the start of a six-week program of cancellations itâ€™s making as it seeks to reduce a backlog of crew vacation required by Irish regulators before the end of the year.
