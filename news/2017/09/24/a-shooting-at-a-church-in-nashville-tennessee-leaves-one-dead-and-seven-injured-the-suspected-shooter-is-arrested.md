##### Burnette Chapel shooting
# A shooting at a church in Nashville, Tennessee, leaves one dead and seven injured. The suspected shooter is arrested. 

Local police and federal authorities worked Monday to determine why a man went on a deadly shooting spree at a Nashville-area church, while a shocked community prepared for prayer vigils for the victims and their families in the shooting&#039;s aftermath. One person was killed and seven others injured Sunday as services were wrapping up at the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch, near Nashville.
