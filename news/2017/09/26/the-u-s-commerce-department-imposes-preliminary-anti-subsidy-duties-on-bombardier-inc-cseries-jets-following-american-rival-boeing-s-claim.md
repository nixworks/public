# The U.S. Commerce Department imposes preliminary anti-subsidy duties on Bombardier Inc. CSeries jets following American rival Boeing's claims of unfair Canadian subsidies. The penalty is on hold pending the U.S. International Trade Commission's final decision, expected in 2018. 

The decision involving the Bombardier company threatens to inflame trade tensions between the North American neighbors.
