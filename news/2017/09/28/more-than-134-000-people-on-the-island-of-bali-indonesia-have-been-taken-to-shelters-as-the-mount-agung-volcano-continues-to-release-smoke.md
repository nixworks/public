##### Ring of Fire
# More than 134,000 people on the island of Bali, Indonesia, have been taken to shelters as the Mount Agung volcano continues to release smoke. The alert level for an eruption has been raised to the second highest level, 4. In addition, the entire population of Vanuatu's Aoba Island, also at alert level 4, is being moved from the path of the increasingly active Lombenben volcano. 

AS BALIâ€™S Mt Agung volcano continues to rumble ominously and more than 96,000 people evacuate to shelters, the locals are blaming tourists for angering the ancient mountain.
