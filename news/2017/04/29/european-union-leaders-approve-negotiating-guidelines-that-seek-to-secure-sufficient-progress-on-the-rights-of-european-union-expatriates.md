##### Brexit
# European Union leaders approve negotiating guidelines that seek to secure "sufficient progress" on the rights of European Union expatriates living in the United Kingdom, on the financial terms of the separation and on a "soft border" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, before committing to talk about a new free trade deal. 

European Union leaders endorsed stiff divorce terms for Britain on Saturday and warned Britons to have &quot;no illusions&quot; about swiftly securing a new relationship to keep their access to EU markets.
