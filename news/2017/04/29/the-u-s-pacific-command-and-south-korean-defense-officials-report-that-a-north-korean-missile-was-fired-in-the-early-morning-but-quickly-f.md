# The U.S. Pacific Command and South Korean defense officials report that a North Korean missile was fired in the early morning, but quickly failed and did not travel beyond North Korea, echoing a similar failed attempt by North Korea thirteen days ago. 

The missile exploded shortly after launch, but Kim&rsquo;s ambitions are clear.
