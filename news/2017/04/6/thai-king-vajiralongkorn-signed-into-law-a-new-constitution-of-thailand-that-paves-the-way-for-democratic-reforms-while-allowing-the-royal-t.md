# Thai King Vajiralongkorn signed into law a new Constitution of Thailand that paves the way for democratic reforms while allowing the Royal Thai Army to retain its influential role in Thai politics. 

The move allows for a return to democracy after a 2014 coup, but the military will retain influence.
