##### United Kingdom
# The United Kingdom, on Friday, did not derive energy from any coal-fired source, the first continuous 24-hour, coal-free period for the UK since use of the fossil fuel began. Coal accounted for just 9 percent of the electricity generated last year. 

The country has its first full day without using coal to generate electricity since the 1800s in a &quot;watershed moment&quot; for energy.
