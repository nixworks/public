##### Carnival
# An explosion occurs at a carnival in Villepinte, Seine-Saint-Denis, France, injuring at least 18 people. 

A huge explosion rocked a popular French carnival, injuring at least 18 people. Onlookers were hit by chunks of burning wood and other debris after the fireball erupted from the guy-style figure known as Mr Carnival which was made of straw and wood. &quot;Many are injured in the face, and all are in hospital,&quot; said Nathalie Crespin, a spokeswoman for the Paris fire brigade, adding that five were &quot;in a very bad way.&quot;
