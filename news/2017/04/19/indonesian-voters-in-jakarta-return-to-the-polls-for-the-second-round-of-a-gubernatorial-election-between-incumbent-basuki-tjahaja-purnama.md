##### Jakarta gubernatorial election, 2017
# Indonesian voters in Jakarta return to the polls for the second round of a gubernatorial election between incumbent Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, whose alleged blasphemy sparked mass protests in November, and Anies Baswedan. Opinion polls give Baswedan a narrow lead. 

The second round of voting in a bitterly fought campaign for Jakarta&#039;s top job will take place tomorrow, and while it is difficult to predict who will win, unrest over either outcome is likely.
