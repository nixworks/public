##### Israeli-Palestinian conflict
# Following last month's manslaughter conviction, Israeli soldier Elor Azaria is sentenced to 18 months in prison by a military court for, during a violent incident, his deadly shooting of the wounded, unarmed, prone Palestinian Abdel Fattah al-Sharif, who had stabbed a soldier last March in Hebron. 

The sentence, which also included a year&rsquo;s probation and a demotion in rank, was lighter than expected
