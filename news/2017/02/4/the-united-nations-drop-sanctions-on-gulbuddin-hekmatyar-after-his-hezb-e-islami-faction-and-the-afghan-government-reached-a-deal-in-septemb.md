# The United Nations drop sanctions on Gulbuddin Hekmatyar after his Hezb-e Islami faction and the Afghan government reached a deal in September. Hekmatyar is granted immunity in exchange for his abandoning violence and supporting the Constitution of Afghanistan. 

The move is part of a peace deal paving the way for Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to return to Afghanistan.
