# According to a report released by Malegapuru William Makgoba, 94 mentally ill patients in South Africa died from starvation, dehydration and diarrhea between March and December 2016 because of a "reckless" government attempt to save money by transferring the patients from a specialized institution to care centres with "invalid licenses". 

A &quot;reckless&quot; attempt to save cash leads to starvation and dehydration deaths, ombudsman says.
