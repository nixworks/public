##### Anti-bullfighting
# An explosion kills one and injures at least 30 people, mostly police officers preparing for the weekly anti-bullfighting protests in Bogota, Colombia. Bullfighting resumed last month after a four-year lull, per a Supreme Court order. Responsibility has not been determined. 

Animal rights activists were due to hold an anti-bullfighting march close to where the blast happened.
