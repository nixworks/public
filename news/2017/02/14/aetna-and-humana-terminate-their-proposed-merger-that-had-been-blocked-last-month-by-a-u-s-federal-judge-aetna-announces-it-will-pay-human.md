# Aetna and Humana terminate their proposed merger that had been blocked last month by a U.S. federal judge. Aetna announces it will pay Humana the $1 billion fee for calling off the agreement. 

Aetna and Humana said they have terminated their merger agreement after a U.S. District Court Judge earlier this month ruled against the deal, effectively blocking the combination.
