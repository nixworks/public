##### War in Afghanistan (2015-present)
# At least 18 people are killed and 6 others injured in a car bomb explosion in Khost, eastern Afghanistan. 

At least 18 people, mostly civilians, were killed when a suicide car bomber targeted a convoy of provincial security forces in eastern Afghanistan, an Interior Ministry official said. Najib Danish, the ministryâ€™s deputy spokesman, said the target of the bomber was a group of guards providing security for US forces in Khost province, but most of the victims were civilians. No group immediately claimed responsibility, but Taliban insurgents have increased their attacks against Afghan security forces since announcing their spring offensive last month.
