# Israeli Minister of Construction Yoav Galant states that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should be assassinated.

The Syrian government denies the accusations. 

An Israeli cabinet member on Tuesday claimed that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should not simply be removed from office -- he should be killed.
