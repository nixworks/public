##### New Orleans City Council
# The New Orleans City Council removes the statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis in New Orleans. This action is the second of four planned removals of Confederate monuments in the city. 

Mayor Mitch Landrieu and his allies say monuments to Confederate-era figures celebrate the &quot;cult of the Lost Cause&quot; and hold the city back.
