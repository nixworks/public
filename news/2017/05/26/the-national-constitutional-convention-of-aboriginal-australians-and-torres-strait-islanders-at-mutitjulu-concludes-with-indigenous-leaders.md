### [2017-05-26](/news/2017/05/26/index.md)

# The National Constitutional Convention of Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders at Mutitjulu concludes with Indigenous leaders calling for a treaty and reforms to the Constitution of Australia, beyond the proposed written recognition, including entrenchment of representative bodies and commissions for Indigenous rights. 

Indigenous leaders from across the country reject the idea of being recognised in the constitution, endorsing a treaty instead and calling for a referendum for a voice in Parliament.
