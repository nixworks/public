##### Immigration policy of Donald Trump
# The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit refuses to reinstate Executive Order 13780 on the basis of religious discrimination, upholding the District Court for Maryland's March 7 ruling. 

In a stinging rebuke to President Donald Trump, a U.S. appeals court refused on Thursday to reinstate his temporary travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority nations, setting the stage for a possible legal showdown in the Supreme Court.
