# Nine men are found dead inside a tractor-trailer parked outside a Walmart store in the American city of San Antonio, Texas, in what authorities call a case of "ruthless" human trafficking. Thirty people, many in critical condition and suffering from heat stroke and exhaustion, were removed from the non-air conditioned trailer which also lacked a water supply. 

Eight people, including two children, were found Sunday morning inside a tractor-trailer in the parking lot of a Walmart store in San Antonio, according to reports.
