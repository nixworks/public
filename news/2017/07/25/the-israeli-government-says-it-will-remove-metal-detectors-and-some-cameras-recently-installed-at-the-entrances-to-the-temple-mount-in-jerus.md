# The Israeli government says it will remove metal detectors and some cameras recently installed at the entrances to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem that resulted in a wave of protests and some deaths. Instead, less obtrusive surveillance means will be used. 

After days of violent protests and a diplomatic crisis with Jordan over the placement of metal detectors at the entrances to the Aqsa Compound, the Israeli government said it would remove them.
