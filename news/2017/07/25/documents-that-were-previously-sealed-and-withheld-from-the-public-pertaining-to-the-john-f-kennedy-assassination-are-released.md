##### John F. Kennedy assassination
# Documents that were previously sealed and withheld from the public pertaining to the John F. Kennedy assassination are released. 

The National Archives and Records Administration is releasing documents previously withheld in accordance with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act. The vast majority of the Collection (88%) has been open in full and released to the public since the late 1990s. The records at issue are documents previously identified as assassination records, but withheld in full or withheld in part. Learn more
