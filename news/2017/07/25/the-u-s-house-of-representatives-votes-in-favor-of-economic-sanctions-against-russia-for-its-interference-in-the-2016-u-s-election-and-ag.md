##### United States embargoes
# The U.S. House of Representatives votes in favor of economic sanctions against Russia for its interference in the 2016 U.S. election, and against Iran and North Korea for their weapons programs. 

The House bill would impose new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea, and prevent President Trump from easing some of them without congressional approval.
