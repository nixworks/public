# Aftershocks cause panic in the Greek island of Kos after a deadly earthquake that injured hundreds. 

Two strong aftershocks have struck the Greek island of Kos within minutes of each other, sending startled residents and tourists scurrying away from homes and restaurants. A tremor measuring a preliminary 4.4 magnitude struck at 8.09pm local time (6.09on BST), sending restaurant customers scurrying toward the middle of the town&#039;s main square, as far away as possible from buildings.
