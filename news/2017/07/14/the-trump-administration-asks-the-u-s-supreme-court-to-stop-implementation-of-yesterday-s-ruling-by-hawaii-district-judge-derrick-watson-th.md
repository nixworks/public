##### Presidency of Donald Trump
# The Trump Administration asks the U.S. Supreme Court to stop implementation of yesterday's ruling by Hawaii District Judge Derrick Watson that expanded the State Department's definition of "close family" used to implement the Supreme Court's June order that permits admission to the U.S. of those with a bona fide relationship. 

U.S. lays out criteria for visa applicants from six Muslim nationsVisa applicants from six Muslim-majority countries must have a close U.S. family relationship or formal ties to a U.S. entity to be admitted to the United States under guidance distributed by the U.S. State Department on Wednesday. Here is the text of the cable:Date:June 28, 2017 at 7:57:39 PM EDTSubject: (SBU) IMPLEMENTING EXECUTIVE ORDER 13780 FOLLOWING SUPREME COURTRULING -- GUIDANCE TO VISA-ADJUDICATING POSTSFrom: SECSTATE WASHDCAction: ALL DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR POSTS COLLECTIVE IMMEDIATE1. (SBU) Summary: On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court partiallylifted preliminary injunctions that barred the Department from enforcingsection 2 of Executive Order (E.O.) 13780, which suspends the entry to theUnited States of, and the issuance of visas to, nationals of six designatedcountries, as well as section 6, which relates to the Refugee AdmissionsProgram. A June 14, 2017 Presidential Memorandum announced each enjoinedprovision would become effective the date and time at which the referencedinjunctions are lifted or stayed, with implementation of each relevantprovision within 72 hours afterall applicable injunctions are lifted or stayed with respect to that provision.As a result, implementation of those sections for which injunctions have beenlifted will begin June 29, 2017,as detailed below.2. (SBU) This cable provides guidance for implementing provisions ofsection 2(c) of the E.O. impacting visa adjudication and issuanceprocedures. The E.O.’s 90-day suspension of entry will be implementedworldwide at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) June 29, 2017. All visaadjudicating posts should carefully review and prepare to implement thisguidance at that time or at opening of the next business day if not open at 8:00 p.m. EDT June 29, 2017. Anymodifications to this guidance, due to litigation or other reasons, will besent in a subsequent cable. Public talking points and additionaloperational resources will be updated and available on CA Webhttp://intranet.ca.state.sbu/content/caweb/visas/news/100011.html&gt;. End Summary.3. (SBU) The Supreme Court’s partial lifting of the preliminaryinjunctions allows the E.O.’s suspension to be enforced only against foreignnationals who lack a “bona fide relationship with a person or entity in theUnited States.” Therefore, applicants who are nationals of the affectedcountries who are determined to be otherwise eligible for visas and to have acredible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in theUnited States are exempt from the suspension of entry in the United States asdescribed in section 2(c) of the E.O. Applicants who are nationals of theaffected countries and who are determined to be otherwise eligible for visas,but who are determined not to have a qualifying relationship, must be eligiblefor an exemption or waiver as described in section 3 of the E.O. in order to beissued a visa. For adjudication purposes, the Supreme Court criteria havebeen couched in this guidance as exemptions from the E.O.’s suspension of entryin paragraph 10.(SBU) Suspension of Entry into the United States for Aliens from CertainCountries4. (SBU) The E.O. exercises the President’s authority under sections212(f) and 215(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and suspendsfor 90 days entry into the United States of, and issuance of visas to, certainaliens from the following countries: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria,and Yemen. Implementation of the suspension, for purposes of visaissuance, will begin at 8:00 p.m. EDTJune29, 2017, worldwide. The suspension of entry in the E.O.does not apply to individuals who are inside the United States on June 29, 2017, who have a validvisa on June 29, 2017,or who had a valid visa at 8:00 p.m. EDT January 29, 2017, even after theirvisas expire or they leave the United States. The suspension of entryalso does not apply to other categories of individuals, as detailedbelow. No visas will be revoked based on the E.O., even if issued duringthe period in which Section 2(c) was enjoined by court order or during the72-hour implementation period. New applicants will be reviewed on acase-by-case basis, with consular officers taking into account the scope andexemption provisions in the E.O. and the applicant’s qualification for adiscretionary waiver. Direction and guidance to resume normal processingof visas following the 90-day suspension will be sent septel.(SBU) Nonimmigrant Visas5. (SBU) GSS vendors and posts will continue scheduling NIV applicants ofthe six indicated nationalities. The E.O. provides for a number ofexemptions from its scope and includes waiver provisions, and whether anapplicant is exempt or qualified for a waiver can only be determined on acase-by-case basis during the course of a visa interview.6. (SBU) Beginning 8:00 p.m. EDT June 29, 2017, NIV applicantspresenting passports from any of the six countries included in the E.O. shouldbe interviewed and adjudicated following these procedures:a.) Officers should first determine whether the applicant is eligible for avisa under the INA, without regard to the E.O. If the applicant is noteligible, the appropriate refusal code should be entered into the ConsularLookout and Support System (CLASS). See 9 FAM 303.3-4(A). Postsmust follow existing FAM guidance in 9 FAM 304.2 to determine whether an SAOmust be submitted. Applicants found ineligible for grounds unrelated tothe E.O. should be refused according to standard procedures.b.) If an applicant is found otherwise eligible for the visa, the consularofficer will need to determine during the interview whether the applicant isexempt from the E.O.’s suspension of entry provision (see paragraphs 10-13),and if not, whether the individual qualifies for a waiver (see paragraphs 14and 15).c.) Applicants who are not exempt from the E.O.’s suspension of entry provisionand who do not qualify for a waiver should be refused by entering the code“EO17” into the Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS). Ascoordinated with DHS, this code represents a Section 212(f) denial under theE.O.(SBU) Immigrant Visas7. (SBU) The National Visa Center (NVC) will continue to scheduleimmigrant visa (IV) appointments for all categories and allnationalities. Posts should continue to interview all other IV applicantspresenting passports from any of the six countries included in the E.O.,following these procedures:a.) Officers should first determine whether the applicant is eligible for thevisa, without regard to the E.O. If the applicant is not eligible, theapplication should be refused according to standard procedures.b.) If an applicant is found otherwise eligible for the visa, the consularofficer will need to determine during the interview whether the applicant isexempt from the E.O.’s suspension of entry provision (see paragraphs 10-13),and if not, whether the applicant qualifies for a waiver (paragraphs 14 and15).c.) Immigrant visa applicants who are not exempt from the E.O.’s suspension ofentry provision and who do not qualify for a waiver should be refused 221(g)and the consular officer should request an advisory opinion from VO/L/A.(SBU) Diversity Visas8. (SBU) For Diversity Visa (DV) applicants already scheduled forinterviews falling after the E.O. implementation date of 8:00 p.m. EDTJune29, 2017, post should interview the applicants. Postsshould interview applicants following these procedures:a.) Officers should first determine whether the applicant is eligible for theDV, without regard to the E.O. If the applicant is not eligible, theapplication should be refused according to standard procedures.b.) If an applicant is found otherwise eligible, the consular officer will needto determine during the interview whether the applicant is exempt from theE.O.’s suspension of entry provision (see paragraphs 10-13), and if not,whether the applicant qualifies for a waiver (paragraphs 14 and 15).c.) DV applicants who are not exempt from the E.O.’s suspension of entryprovision and who do not qualify for a waiver should be refused 221(g) and theconsular officer should request an advisory opinion from VO/L/A followingcurrent guidance in 9 FAM 304.3-1.Based on the Department’s experience with the DV program, we anticipate thatvery few DV applicants are likely to be exempt from the E.O.’s suspension ofentry or to qualify for a waiver. CA will notify DV applicants from theaffected nationalities with scheduled interviews of the additional criteria toallow the potential applicants to determine whether they wish to pursue theirapplication.9. (SBU) The Kentucky Consular Center (KCC) will continue to scheduleadditional DV-2017 appointments for cases in which the principal applicant isfrom one of these six nationalities. While the Department is mindful ofthe requirement to issue Diversity Visas prior to the end of the FiscalYear on September 30, direction andguidance to resume normal processing of visas following the 90-day suspensionwill be sent septel.(SBU) Individuals Who Are Exempt from the E.O.’s Suspension of Entry10. (SBU) The E.O.’s suspension of entry does not apply to the following:a.) Any applicant who has a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with aperson or entity in the United States. Any such relationship with a“person” must be a close familial relationship, as defined below. Anyrelationship with an entity must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinarycourse, rather than for the purpose of evading the E.O. Note: Ifyou determine an applicant has established eligibility for a nonimmigrant visain a classification other than a B, C-1, D, I, or K visa, then the applicant isexempt from the E.O., as their bona fide relationship to a person or entity isinherent in the visa classification. Eligible derivatives of theseclassifications are also exempt. Likewise, if you determine an applicanthas established eligibility for an immigrant visa in the following classifications-- immediate relatives, family-based, and employment-based (other than certainself-petitioning employment-based first preference applicants with no job offerin the United States and SIV applicants under INA 101a(27)) -- then theapplicant and any eligible derivatives are exempt from the E.O.b.) Any applicant who was in the United States on June 26, 2017;c.) Any applicant who had a valid visa at 5:00 p.m. EST on January 27, 2017, the dayE.O. 13769 was signed;d.) Any applicant who had a valid visa on June 29, 2017;e.) Any lawful permanent resident of the United States;f.) Any applicant who is admitted to or paroled into the United States on orafter June 26, 2017;g.) Any applicant who has a document other than a visa, valid on June 29, 2017, or issuedon any date thereafter, that permits him or her to travel to the United Statesand seek entry or admission, such as advance parole;h.) Any dual national of a country designated under the order when traveling ona passport issued by a non-designated country;i.) Any applicant travelling on an A-1, A-2, NATO-1 through NATO-6 visa, C-2for travel to the United Nations, C-3, G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa, or adiplomatic-type visa of any classification;j.) Any applicant who has been granted asylum; any refugee who has already beenadmitted to the United States; or any individual who has been grantedwithholding of removal, advance parole, or protection under the ConventionAgainst Torture; andk.) Any V92 or V93 applicant.11. (SBU) “Close family” is defined as a parent (includingparent-in-law), spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law,daughter-in-law, sibling, whether whole or half. This includes steprelationships. “Close family” does not include grandparents,grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-laws andsisters-in-law, fianc&#233;s, and any other “extended” family members.12. (SBU) A relationship with a “U.S. entity” must be formal, documented,and formed in the ordinary course rather than for the purpose of evading theE.O. A consular officer should not issue a visa unless the officer issatisfied that the applicant’s relationship complies with these requirementsand was not formed for the purpose of evading the E.O. For example, aneligible I visa applicant employed by foreign media that has a news officebased in the United States would be covered by this exemption. Studentsfrom designated countries who have been admitted to U.S. educationalinstitutions have a required relationship with an entity in the UnitedStates. Similarly, a worker who accepted an offer of employment from acompany in the United States or a lecturer invited to address an audience inthe United States would be exempt. In contrast, the exemption would notapply to an applicant who enters into a relationship simply to avoid theE.O.: for example, a nonprofit group devoted to immigration issues maynot contact foreign nationals from the designated countries, add them to clientlists, and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their inclusion inthe E.O. Also, a hotel reservation, whether or not paid, would notconstitute a bona fide relationship with an entity in the United States.13. (SBU) When issuing an IV or an NIV to an individual who falls intoone of the categories listed in paragraph 10, the visa should be annotated tostate, “Exempt or Waived from E.O. 13780.” Interviewing officers mustalso enter a clear case note stating the specific reason why the applicant isexempt from the E.O.’s suspension of entry. If consular officers areunclear if an applicant qualifies for an exemption, the cases should be refusedunder INA 221(g) and the consular officer should request an advisory opinionfrom VO/L/A following current guidance in 9 FAM 304.3-1.(SBU) Qualification for a Waiver and Process14. (SBU) The E.O. permits consular officers to grant waivers andauthorize the issuance of a visa on a case-by-case basis when the applicantdemonstrates to the officer’s satisfaction that the following three criteriaare all met:a.) Denying entry during the 90-day suspension would cause undue hardship;b.) His or her entry would not pose a threat to national security; andc.) His or her entry would be in the national interest.15. (SBU) The E.O. lists the following examples of circumstances in whichan applicant may be considered for a waiver, subject to meeting the threerequirements above. Note that some of the waiver examples listed in theE.O. are now considered exemptions in light of the Supreme Court’sruling. Consular officers should determine whether individuals are exemptfrom the E.O. under standards described above, before considering theavailability of a waiver under the standards described in this paragraph. Unless the adjudicating consular officer has particular concerns about a casethat causes the officer to believe that that issuance may not be in thenational interest, a determination that a case falls under any circumstancelisted in this paragraph is a sufficient basis for concluding a waiver is inthe national interest. Determining that a case falls under some of thesecircumstances may also be a sufficient basis for concluding that denying entryduring the 90-day suspension would cause undue hardship:a.) The applicant has previously established significant contacts with theUnited States but is outside the United States on the effective date of theE.O. for work, study, or other lawful activity;b.) The applicant seeks to enter the United States for significant business orprofessional obligations and the denial of entry during the suspension periodwould impair those obligations;c.) The applicant is an infant, a young child, or adoptee, an individualneeding urgent medical care, or someone whose entry is otherwise justified bythe special circumstances of the case;d.) The applicant is traveling for purposes related to an internationalorganization designated under the International Organizations Immunities Act,traveling for purposes of conducting meetings or business with the UnitedStates government, or traveling to conduct business on behalf of aninternational organization not designated under the IOIA; ore.) The applicant is a permanent resident of Canada who applies for a visa at alocation within Canada.16. (SBU) Listed in this paragraph are other circumstances in which anapplicant may be considered for a waiver, subject to meeting the threerequirements in paragraph 14. Consular officers should determine whetherindividuals are exempt from the E.O. under standards described above, beforeconsidering the availability of a waiver under the standards in paragraph15. Unless the adjudicating consular officer has particular concernsabout a case that suggest issuance may not be in the national interest, determiningthat a case falls under any circumstance listed in this paragraph is asufficient basis for concluding a waiver is in the national interest. Determining that a case falls under some of these circumstances may also be asufficient basis for concluding that denying entry during the 90-day suspensionwould cause undue hardship:a.) The applicant is a high-level government official traveling on officialbusiness who is not eligible for the diplomatic visa normally accorded toforeign officials of national governments (A or G visa). Examples includegovernors and other appropriate members of sub-national (state/local/regional)governments; and members of sub-national and regional security forces; andb.) Cases where all three criteria in paragraph 14 are met and the Chiefof Mission or Assistant Secretary of a Bureau supports the waiver.17. (SBU) If the applicant qualifies for a waiver based on criteria inparagraphs 14 or 15, the consular officer may issue the visa with theconcurrence of the Visa Chief (IV or NIV) or the Consular Section Chief. The visa should be annotated to read, “Exempt or Waived from E.O. 13780.” Case notes must reflect the basis for the waiver; the undue hardship that wouldbe caused by denying entry during the suspension; the national interest; andthe position title of the manager concurring with the waiver. To documentnational interest in case notes in circumstances falling under paragraph 14 orparagraph 15(a), (b), or (c), the consular officer may write, “Nationalinterest was established by the applicant demonstrating satisfaction of therequirements for the waiver based on [insert brief description of category ofwaiver].”18. (SBU) If the applicant does not qualify under one of the listedwaiver categories in paragraphs 14 or 15, but the interviewing officer andconsular manager believe that the applicant meets the requirements in paragraph14 above and therefore should qualify for a waiver, then the case should besubmitted to the Visa Office for consideration. These cases should besubmitted via email to countries-of-concern-inquiries@state.gov. The Visa Office will review these requests and reply to posts within twobusiness days. Consular officers should be able to approve the majorityof waiver cases without review by the Visa Office due to the broad authoritygranted in the E.O.(SBU) Refugees19. (SBU) The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) is suspended for120 days, except for those cases where the Supreme Court has kept the temporaryinjunction in place for any applicant who has a credible claim of a bona fiderelationship with a person or entity in the United States. Any suchrelationship with a “person” must be a close familial relationship, as definedabove in paragraph 11. Any relationship with an entity must be formal,documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose ofevading the E.O as described in paragraph 12. We believe that by theirnature, almost all V93 cases will have a clear and credible close familialrelationship with the Form I-730 petitioner in the United States and qualifyfor issuance under this exemption.20. (SBU) Posts should not cancel any V93 appointments, and NVC willcontinue to schedule new V93 appointment as normal. Beginning 8:00 p.m. EDT Thursday June 29, 2017, V93applicants presenting passports from any of the six countries included in theE.O. should be interviewed and adjudicated following these procedures:a.) Officers should first determine whether the applicant is eligible for a V93under the current policy, without regard to the E.O. If the applicant isnot eligible, the appropriate refusal code should be entered into the ConsularLookout and Support System (CLASS). Applicants found ineligible forgrounds unrelated to the E.O. should be refused according to standardprocedures. See 9 FAM 203.6.b.) If an applicant is found otherwise eligible for the V93 foil, the consularofficer will need to determine during the interview whether the applicant isexempt from the E.O.’s suspension of entry provision based on a credible claimof a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States perparagraph 19.c.) Applicants who are not exempt from the E.O.’s suspension of entry provisionshould be refused by entering the code “EO17” into the Consular Lookout andSupport System (CLASS). Please contact your VO/F liaison with anyquestions about V93 processing or adjudication under the E.O.(SBU) V92 Cases21. (SBU) The E.O. does not affect V92 applicants, and post shouldadjudicate these cases per standard guidance.22. (SBU) Posts with questions regarding this guidance should contacttheir post liaison officer in CA/VO/F.
