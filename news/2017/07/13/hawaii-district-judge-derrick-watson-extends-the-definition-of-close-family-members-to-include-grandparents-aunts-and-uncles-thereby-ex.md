# Hawaii District Judge Derrick Watson extends the definition of "close family members" to include grandparents, aunts, and uncles, thereby exempting them from President Donald Trump's travel ban on six Muslim-majority nations. 

A U.S. District Court judge in Hawaii ordered the Trump administration not to enforce the travel ban on grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, and other relatives.
