##### North Korea's nuclear program
# North Korea test-launches what is presumed to be its first intercontinental ballistic missile 933 kilometers into the Sea of Japan within Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone. An American expert theorizes the ICBM, which reached an altitude of 2,802 km, could potentially reach the U.S. state of Alaska. 

Donald Trump says it is hard to believe South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer after North Korean launches its latest missile.
