##### U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
# U.S. Appeals Court Judge Patricia Millett rejects the Federal Aviation Administration argument that seat size is unimportant when passengers exit a plane in an emergency, and orders the FAA to set minimum standards for the space airlines give passengers. 

U.S. aviation authorities were ordered back to the drawing board on Friday to solve what a federal appeals judge called &quot;The Case of the Incredible Shrinking Airline Seat.&quot;
