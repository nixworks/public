Prosecutors say the controller had been playing a game on his mobile phone, which led to his making signalling errors.

2. [Two passenger trains collide in the German town of Bad Aibling in the state of Bavaria. At least ten people are dead, one person is missing and presumed dead, about 80 are wounded, and 17 are seriously or critically injured. The rescue is difficult - resembling a mountain-type rescue - because of a nearby river and a steep incline and a curve in the tracks; rescue helicopters had to be used. It is one of Bavaria's and Germany's deadliest-ever railroad accidents. Human error is being examined as a possibility. ](/news/2016/02/9/two-passenger-trains-collide-in-the-german-town-of-bad-aibling-in-the-state-of-bavaria-at-least-ten-people-are-dead-one-person-is-missing.md) _Context: Bavaria, German_
