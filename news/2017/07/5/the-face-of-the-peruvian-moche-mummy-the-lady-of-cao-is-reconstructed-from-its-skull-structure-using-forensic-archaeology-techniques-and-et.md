# The face of the Peruvian Moche mummy the Lady of Cao is reconstructed from its skull structure, using forensic archaeology techniques and ethnographic research. 

She died in her twenties some 1700 years ago, and is believed to have ruled over a desert valley in ancient Peru where her elaborately tattooed body was buried.
