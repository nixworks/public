##### Net neutrality in the United States
# Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai announces his agency will take steps to repeal the regulations put in place under the Obama administration, including the classification of broadband Internet as a public utility. 

A rollback of net neutrality regulations would represent a significant victory for broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast and would amount to a strike against consumers.
