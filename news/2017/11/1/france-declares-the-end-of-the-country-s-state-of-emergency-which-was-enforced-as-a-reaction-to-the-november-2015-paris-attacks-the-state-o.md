##### States of emergency in France
# France declares the end of the country's state of emergency which was enforced as a reaction to the November 2015 Paris attacks. The state of emergency gets replaced with a new counterterrorism law signed by President Emmanuel Macron. 

The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has declared the country&#039;s state of emergency will end tomorrow on 1 November, almost two years after the 2015 Paris attacks. Mr Macron formally signed a sweeping counterterrorism law to replace the state of emergency, which is meant to give police more tools to fight violent extremism. The bill was adopted by a large majority at parliament earlier this month.
