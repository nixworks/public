##### 2017 Lebanon-Saudi Arabia dispute
# Saudi Arabia, and subsequently the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, urge all citizens currently in Lebanon to leave the country immediately. Recently, Saudi Arabia declared that a missile attack on its airport from Yemen was "an act of war" by Lebanon. 

Governments of three Gulf states urge citizens to leave &#39;as soon as possible&#39; and warn against travelling to Lebanon.
