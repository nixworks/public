##### France-Lebanon relations
# Prime Minister of Lebanon Saad Hariri meets President of France Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris. 

PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Saad Hariri for talks Saturday, an AFP reporter said, hours after the Lebanese premier arrived from Saudi Arabia in the midst of a political crisis. Hariri, who made a resignation announcement on November 4 and has since fended off claims he was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will, was also due to have lunch with Macron. Macron has been attempting to help broker a solution to a political crisis that has raised fears over Lebanon’s fragile democracy.
