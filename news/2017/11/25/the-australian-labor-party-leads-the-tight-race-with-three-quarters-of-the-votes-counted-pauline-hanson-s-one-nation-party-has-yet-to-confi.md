##### Queensland state election, 2017
# The Australian Labor Party leads the tight race with three-quarters of the votes counted. Pauline Hanson's One Nation party has yet to confirm victory in any contest; the nationalists are projected to win just one seat though they may poll better overall than the predicted 20 percent. Official results may not be known for several days.
