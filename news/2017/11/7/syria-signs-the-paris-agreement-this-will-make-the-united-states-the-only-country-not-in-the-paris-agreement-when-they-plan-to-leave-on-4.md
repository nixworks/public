##### Paris Agreement parties and signatories
# Syria signs the Paris Agreement. This will make the United States the only country not in the Paris Agreement, when they plan to leave on 4 November 2020. 

Syria’s decision means America will be the only country outside the landmark deal if it follows through with Donald Trump’s vow to leave
