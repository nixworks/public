##### Government formation in Germany, 2017
# The Free Democratic Party (FDP), which was in discussions over forming a government with the CDU, CSU and Alliance 90-The Greens, announced that the party refuses further coalition negotiations. The main reasons for the failure were questions about the politics concerning migration and environment. 

Chancellor Angela Merkel left facing prospect of forming minority government – or fresh elections – after FDP quits negotiations
