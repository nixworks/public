##### Presidency of Donald Trump
# Days ahead of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India, scheduled to be attended by Ivanka Trump per Prime Minister Narendra Modi's June invitation, reports indicate the United States Department of State, led by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, will not be sending a high-level delegation to support her amid reports of tensions between Tillerson and the White House. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has designated White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed, the White House said on Friday.
