##### Turkey-United States relations
# The White House confirms Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu's announcement that President Donald Trump told Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that America is preparing to stop supplying weapons to ethnic Kurdish fighters in Syria. 

The U.S. will cut off supplies of arms to Kurds in Syria, in a move that will please Turkey but alienate Syrian Kurds who bore much of the fight against ISIS.
