##### Ramesses II
# German and Egyptian archaeologists uncover a humanoid statue with an approximate height of eight metres, believed to be of Ramesses II, at the former site of Heliopolis in northeast Cairo. 

The tall figure was barely visible at first as it lay sideways in a muddy pit between two apartment buildings in northeast Cairo.
