##### U.S. government
# Citing security concerns because of recent terrorist activity, the American and British governments impose a ban affecting inbound-passengers flying from much of the Middle East and North Africa. The ban includes airplane cabin passenger-accessible items such as laptops, tablets, and other electronic devices which are larger than a smartphone. Larger such electronic devices will still be allowed on board in checked baggage which is thus more closely screened and passenger-inaccessible. 

Airlines flying directly from eight countries to the U.S. must stop passengers from carrying almost all electronic devices into the cabin under new U.S. rules.
