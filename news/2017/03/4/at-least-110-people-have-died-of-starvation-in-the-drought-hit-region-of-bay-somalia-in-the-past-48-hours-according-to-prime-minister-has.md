##### Drought
# At least 110 people have died of starvation in the drought-hit region of Bay, Somalia, in the past 48 hours, according to Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khayre. This comes as the United Nations and various non-governmental organizations are warning of potential famine in the country. 

More than 100 people have starved to death in a single region of Somalia within 48 hours due to a severe drought, the country’s prime minister has said. In the first drought-related death toll announced since Somalia&#039;s government declared a national disaster on Tuesday, Hassan Khaire told the nation’s drought committee 110 people had died from hunger in two days in the southwestern Bay region alone.
