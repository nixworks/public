##### 2016-2017 Cook Inlet natural gas leak
# A damaged natural gas pipeline operating under Cook Inlet offshore of Nikiski (near Anchorage, Alaska) continues releasing between 6,000-8,800 cubic meters (210,000-310,000 cubic feet) of gas per day. Pipeline operator Hilcorp Energy states that due to sea ice conditions, repairs will not be possible for weeks. 

It&#039;s pumping out 210,000 cubic feet of gas per day, but a fix isn&#039;t expected until later this month at the earliest.
