##### Scientific Reports
# "Scientific Reports" publishes Carthage College research that "Daspletosaurus horneri", from the same Tyrannosauridae family as the Tyrannosaurus rex, had a sensitive nose. The research describes that foramina sprouted from the trigeminal nerve at the snout and jaws possibly enabling the behavioral functions of exploration, courtship, nesting, foreplay, and parental investment. 

Tyrannosaurs had sensitive snouts that they may have enjoyed rubbing together while mating, scientists say

The general scientific community has already been using 1950 as the year "Before Physics", when nuclear weapons began to significantly affect the reliability of radiocarbon dating of events that happen after that epoch. ](/news/2018/02/19/in-a-scientific-reports-publication-researchers-propose-1965-as-the-start-of-the-anthropocene-era-in-that-year-human-nuclear-weapons-te.md) _Context: Scientific Reports_
