##### Interstate 85 bridge collapse
# A fire results in the collapse of a bridge on Interstate 85 in Atlanta, Georgia, during rush hour, stranding motorists and resulting in a state of emergency. Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed calls the situation a "transportation crisis" that could close the affected stretch of highway for days or weeks. A 2015 report stated that the highway carried nearly a quarter-million vehicles a day. 

All lanes of one of the busiest commercial throughways in America are expected to be blocked indefinitely in the area, authorities said.
