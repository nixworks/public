# Scientists announce that the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) has made a third detection of gravitational waves, named GW170104. The signal beam, detected on 4 January 2017, apparently results from a merger of two black holes of 19 and 31 solar masses. Such detections are said to be progressively moving this emerging field in astronomy "from novelty to new observational science". 

Scientists pick up once again the distortions in space-time resulting from a huge black hole merger.

The event coincided with a short gamma ray burst GRB 170817A detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, leading to SSS17a, the immediate follow-up observations by the Hubble space telescope and numerous ground-based telescopes. This confirms the theory according to which neutron star mergers are the cause of at least some short gamma-ray bursts. ](/news/2017/10/16/scientists-announce-that-the-ligo-and-virgo-gravitational-wave-observatories-detected-for-the-first-time-gravitational-waves-from-the-merger.md) _Context: Gravitational-wave astronomy, LIGO_
