##### Puerto Rican status referendum, 2017
# With a turnout of 23% eligible voters, 97% of the voters in Puerto Rico request that the island become a U.S. state. 

The economically struggling U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico voted overwhelmingly on Sunday in favor of becoming the 51st state, although turnout was low and adding another star to the U.S. flag likely faces an uphill battle in Congress.
