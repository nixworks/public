# The oldest fossil records of "Homo sapiens" are discovered in Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, dated at between 300,000 and 350,000 years old. The earliest "Homo sapiens" fossils had been dated as 200,000 years old. 

The 300,000-year-old modern humans are roughly 100,000 years older than other fossils of our species.
