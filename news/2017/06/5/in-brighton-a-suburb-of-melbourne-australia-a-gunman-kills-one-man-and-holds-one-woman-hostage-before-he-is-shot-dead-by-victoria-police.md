##### 2017 Brighton siege
# In Brighton, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia, a gunman kills one man and holds one woman hostage before he is shot dead by Victoria Police. The incident is being treated as an act of terrorism. Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant has claimed responsibility for the attack but Victoria Police claim that there is little evidence to suggest a connection. 

Police say they are treating yesterday&#039;s shooting and hostage situation in Melbourne, which left two people dead, including the gunman, as terrorism. Yacqub Khayre (pictured) was shot dead after a stand-off with armed officers.
