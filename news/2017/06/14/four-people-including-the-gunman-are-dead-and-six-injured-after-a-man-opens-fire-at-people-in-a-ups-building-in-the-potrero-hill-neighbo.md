##### San Francisco UPS shooting
# Four people, including the gunman, are dead, and six injured, after a man opens fire at people in a UPS building in the Potrero Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California. 

At least three people were killed and two injured when a man dressed in a UPS uniform let loose a barrage of gunfire Wednesday morning at the delivery company’s building in the Potrero Hill area of San Francisco, officials said. In addition to the three dead, the gunman shot himself in the head when confronted by police inside the building and later died, Assistant Police Chief Toney Chaplin said. Near the emergency room door, a woman in jeans and a sweatshirt who declined to give her name said she was waiting for news from doctors about the condition of her father, who she said was a UPS employee. A man in a brown UPS uniform who said he had been inside the four-story building when the gunfire broke out said at least three people had been shot. Several people believed to be UPS employees stood on the rooftop parking area at the building with their hands raised, apparently to indicate they were not involved and needed assistance. A man who lives a half block from the UPS center and who identified himself only as “Chino” said he saw several people, their bodies covered with blood, dragged from the building by uniformed officers or firefighters and loaded into ambulances. Dozens of police cars, sheriff’s cars and fire department vehicles were in the area, along with several ambulances. At least 350 people work at the sprawling UPS building, which is a package sorting and delivery center. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was sending a team to the crime scene to help in the investigation. UPS officials also issued a statement saying that police “have control of the facility” and that “the company is cooperating with law enforcement.”
