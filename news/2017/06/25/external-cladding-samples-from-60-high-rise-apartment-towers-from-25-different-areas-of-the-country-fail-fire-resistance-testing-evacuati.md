##### Grenfell Tower fire
# External cladding samples from 60 high-rise apartment towers, from 25 different areas of the country, fail fire-resistance testing. Evacuation of thousands of apartments is underway as workers start to remove the deficient covering. 

The cladding is believed to have rapidly spread the inferno at London&#8217;s Grenfell Tower that killed at least 79 people
