# A Ninth Circuit Appeals Court panel unanimously upholds the Hawaii district court decision to prevent implementation of revised Executive Order 13780. On May 25, the Fourth Circuit Appeals Court affirmed a similar ruling by the Maryland district court. 

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an earlier decision by a federal judge in Hawaii to block the government from enforcing Trump&#x27;s executive order.
