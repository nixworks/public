##### Road accidents in 2017
# A car accident on highway 400 involving 14 vehicles, including two tanker trucks, results in three deaths near Barrie, Ontario. Police suspect distracted driving to be the cause. 

A fatal, 14-vehicle pileup that killed at least three people and left Highway 400 about an hour north of Toronto littered with &quot;tangled, twisted metal&quot; may have been caused by an inattentive transport truck driver, police say.
