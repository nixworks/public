# The presiding judge Saban Maksumic of the Sarajevo, Bosnian war crimes court acquits former Bosnian military officer Naser Oric of the charge of killing three Bosnian Serb prisoners of war during the Bosnian War. In July 2008, the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Netherlands acquitted Oric for failing to prevent the deaths of five Bosnian Serb detainees and the mistreatment of eleven other detainees from late 1992 to early 1993.
