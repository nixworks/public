##### Birth control in the United States
# A Trump administration executive order reverses an Obamacare policy which mandated that employers and insurers provide their employees with birth control, regardless of one's "religious beliefs" or "moral convictions". 

The new rule could strip birth control coverage from millions of women, demolishing an Obama provision.
