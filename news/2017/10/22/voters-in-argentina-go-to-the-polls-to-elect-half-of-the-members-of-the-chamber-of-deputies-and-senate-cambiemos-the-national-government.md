##### Argentine legislative election, 2017
# Voters in Argentina go to the polls to elect half of the members of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate. "Cambiemos", the national government coalition led by president Mauricio Macri, got a clear victory in the four most populated provinces and the city of Buenos Aires. Former president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ran for senator of Buenos and ended second, leading the opposition. 

President Mauricio Macri&rsquo;s governing coalition won strong support in early results from Sunday&rsquo;s congressional elections and appeared headed to its first legislative majority since he took office in 2015.

### Changes:

1. [Voters in Argentina go to the polls to elect half of the members of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate. Recent confirmation of pro-Mapuche activist Santiago Maldonado's death is thought to weaken the presidentially incumbent Cambiemos party's chances, and strengthen the political return of the Front for Victory's former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. ](/news/2017/10/22/voters-in-argentina-go-to-the-polls-to-elect-half-of-the-members-of-the-chamber-of-deputies-and-senate-recent-confirmation-of-pro-mapuche-a.md) _2017-10-23 16:30:06 (First version)_
