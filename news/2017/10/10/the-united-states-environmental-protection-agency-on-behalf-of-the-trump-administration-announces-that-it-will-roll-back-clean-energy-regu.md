##### Environmental policy of the Donald Trump administration
# The United States Environmental Protection Agency, on behalf of the Trump administration, announces that it will roll back clean energy regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, imposed under the Obama-era Clean Power Plan. 

The Trump administration Tuesday will formally withdraw federal limits on carbon emissions at power plants, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said, triggering the next stage of what is likely a yearslong fight over the Obama administrationâ€™s centerpiece for slowing climate change.
