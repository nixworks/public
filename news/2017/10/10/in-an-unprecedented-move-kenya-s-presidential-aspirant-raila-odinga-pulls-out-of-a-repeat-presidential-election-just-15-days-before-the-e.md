##### Kenyan general election, 2017
# In an unprecedented move, Kenya's presidential aspirant, Raila Odinga, pulls out of a repeat presidential election just 15 days before the election. This action comes after the supreme court nullified the elections run on August 8 as being unconstitutional. 

Nasa leader says will not take part in the October 26 election.
