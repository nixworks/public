# Iraqi forces complete the takeover of Kirkuk Governorate, which is outside the autonomous zone accorded by the Constitution of Iraq. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani calls for the state to protect Kurds in northern Iraq. 

Iraqi forces on Friday took control of the last district in the oil-rich province of Kirkuk still in the hands of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters following a three-hour battle, security sources said.
