##### 2017 Madagascar plague outbreak
# The death toll from an outbreak of plague in Madagascar nears 100. So far, there have been 911 cases recorded. 

The Red Cross warns that the growing stigma attached to the plague in Madagascar could undermine efforts to contain the outbreak, which has caused the deaths of close to 100 people.
