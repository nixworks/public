##### Chamelecon
#  An intercity bus is intercepted and sprayed with automatic gunfire in Chamelecon, Cortes department, Honduras, killing some 28 passengers. A note left at the crime scene claims the attack for a defunct guerrilla group, but suspicion immediately falls on the Mara Salvatrucha gang, and have since been convicted for the crime.
