##### Svalbard
#  The Svalbard Undersea Cable System is officially put into operation, giving the island group at 78 North a 40Gb connection to the Norwegian mainland. The dual 1,440&nbsp;km fiber optic lines from Svalbard to Harstad is needed for communicating with polar orbiting satellite stations on Svalbard, some owned by NASA and NOAA.
