##### Stardust spacecraft
#  It appears that Stardust has successfully flown past Comet Wild 2 collecting samples that it will return to Earth in two years time. This is the first sample return mission to a comet and the first time that samples have returned to Earth from any celestial body since 1974. The spacecraft also took detailed images of the comet's icy nucleus. 

After a seven-year wait, scientists have finally been able to analyze the cometary and stellar dust particles captured by the NASA Stardust spacecraft.
