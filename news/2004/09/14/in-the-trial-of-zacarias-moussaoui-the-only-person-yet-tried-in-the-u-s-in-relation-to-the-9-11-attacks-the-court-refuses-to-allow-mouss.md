##### Zacarias Moussaoui
#  In the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person yet tried in the U.S. in relation to the 9-11 attacks, the court refuses to allow Moussaoui to call Camp X-Ray detainees as witnesses, but does allow him to use written evidence from some of the detainees. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Moussaoui, who admits to being a member of al-Qaeda but denies involvement in the 9-11 plot.
