#  An air strike in Iraq reportedly kills Habib Akdas, a man thought to be the leader of a terrorist cell responsible for the November 2003 bombings of two synagogues, a bank, and an embassy in Istanbul. Akdas was thought to have fled from Turkey to neighboring Iraq after the 2003 bombings to escape authorities. 

Turkish television showed video Friday claiming that an al-Qaida cell leader thought to be behind several bombings in Istanbul had been killed in Iraq.
