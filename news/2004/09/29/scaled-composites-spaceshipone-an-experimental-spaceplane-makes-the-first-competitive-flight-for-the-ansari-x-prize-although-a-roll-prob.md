##### Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne
#  Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne, an experimental spaceplane, makes the first competitive flight for the Ansari X Prize. Although a roll problem caused the mission to be aborted early, SpaceShipOne nonetheless reached an estimated 109.1&nbsp;km (358,000&nbsp;ft), which qualifies as a spaceflight.
