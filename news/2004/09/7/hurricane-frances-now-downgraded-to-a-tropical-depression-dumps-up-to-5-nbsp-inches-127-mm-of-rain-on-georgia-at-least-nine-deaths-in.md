#  Hurricane Frances, now downgraded to a tropical depression, dumps up to 5&nbsp;inches (127 mm) of rain on Georgia. At least nine deaths in Florida, two deaths in the Bahamas, and one death in Georgia are blamed on the storm. Damage estimates range widely from US$2 to US$15 billion. NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building was heavily damaged by the storm. 

The director of the hurricane-ravaged Kennedy Space Center offers little hope for an on-time return to flight for NASA&#39;s shuttle fleet.
