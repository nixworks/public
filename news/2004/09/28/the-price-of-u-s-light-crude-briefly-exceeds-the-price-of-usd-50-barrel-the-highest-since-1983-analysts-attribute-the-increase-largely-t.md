##### Crude oil
#  The price of U.S. light crude briefly exceeds the price of USD 50-barrel, the highest since 1983. Analysts attribute the increase largely to concerns over the disruption of oil production in Nigeria; conflicts in Iraq and Saudi Arabia and the effects of Hurricane Ivan are also cited.
