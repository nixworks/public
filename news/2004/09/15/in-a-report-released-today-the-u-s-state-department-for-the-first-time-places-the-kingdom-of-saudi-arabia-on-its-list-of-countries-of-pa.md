##### State Department
#  In a report released today, the U.S. State Department for the first time places the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on its list of "countries of particular concern" (CPCs) that engage in "particularly severe violations" of religious freedom. A designation as a CPC requires the State Department to take whatever steps are necessary&mdash;up to the level of sanctions&mdash;to increase religious tolerance in the designated country.
