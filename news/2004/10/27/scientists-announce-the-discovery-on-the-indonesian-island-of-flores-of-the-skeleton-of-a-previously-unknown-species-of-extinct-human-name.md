#  Scientists announce the discovery on the Indonesian island of Flores of the skeleton of a previously unknown species of extinct human, named "Homo floresiensis." Unusually, the creature, while quite different from modern humans&mdash;as an adult, it stood only 3 feet (90 cm) tall&mdash;dates from only 18,000 years ago, disproving the accepted theory that modern humans became the sole human species 160,000 years ago.
