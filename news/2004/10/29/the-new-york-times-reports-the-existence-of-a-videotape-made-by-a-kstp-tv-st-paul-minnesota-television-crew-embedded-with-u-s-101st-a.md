#  The "New York Times" reports the existence of a videotape made by a KSTP-TV St. Paul, Minnesota, television crew embedded with U.S. 101st Airborne Division troops on April 18, 2003, nine days after Hussein's fall. The videotape shows the sealed explosives containers at Al Qaqaa, clearly displaying the ammunition cache of explosives and other weapons supplies, sealed with the International Atomic Energy Agency seals which were reported by the International Atomic Energy Agency 18 months ago.
