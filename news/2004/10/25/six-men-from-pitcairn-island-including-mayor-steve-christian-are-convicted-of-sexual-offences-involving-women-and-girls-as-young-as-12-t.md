##### Pitcairn Island
#  Six men from Pitcairn Island, including mayor Steve Christian, are convicted of sexual offences involving women and girls as young as 12. The island has a population of 47, mainly descendants of the "Bounty" crew. 

The mayor and five other men on the island of Pitcairn were sentenced to up to six years in prison for a string of rapes and sex attacks, British authorities in New Zealand said Friday.
