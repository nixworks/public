#  The Roman Catholic Church publishes a handbook intended to guide business, cultural], and political leaders in making decisions regarding social issues. The publication comes one week before the U.S. presidential election. In response to a journalist's question as to how Roman Catholics should vote, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls says that "the Holy See never gets involved in electoral or political questions directly". 

A Vatican handbook made public Monday questioned preventive war and denounced the &#8220;horrendous crime&#8221; of abortion, but Vatican officials denied they were trying to influence the U.S. presidential election campaign.
