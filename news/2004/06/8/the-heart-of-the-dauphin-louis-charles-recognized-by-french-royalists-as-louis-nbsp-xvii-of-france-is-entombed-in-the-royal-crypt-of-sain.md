##### Louis&nbsp;XVII of France
#  The heart of the dauphin Louis-Charles, recognized by French royalists as Louis&nbsp;XVII of France, is entombed in the royal crypt of Saint-Denis Basilica outside Paris, 211 years after he perished in the French Revolution. DNA testing had verified the heart as belonging to the son of the guillotined King Louis&nbsp;XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette. No French government officials or members of reigning royal families attend the service.
