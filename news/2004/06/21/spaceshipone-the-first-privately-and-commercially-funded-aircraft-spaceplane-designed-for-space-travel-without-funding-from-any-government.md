##### SpaceShipOne
#  SpaceShipOne, the first privately and commercially funded aircraft-spaceplane designed for space travel without funding from any government, successfully embarks upon its maiden flight into outer space. Designed by legendary aerospace designer Burt Rutan and funded by billionaire Paul Allen, the ship was launched from a larger plane and, after igniting its burners, flew 62 mi into space and back down again, an altitude that officially makes test pilot Michael Melvill an astronaut.
