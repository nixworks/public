#  Iraqi insurgents explode multiple car bombs and seize police stations in a six-city offensive, killing over 100 and wounding at least 320, nearly all Iraqis. U.S officials accuse Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's network of involvement. 

With new violence&#160; just days before transfer of sovereignty to a new Iraqi administration, security has been increased around government buildings, power stations and other locations, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said.
