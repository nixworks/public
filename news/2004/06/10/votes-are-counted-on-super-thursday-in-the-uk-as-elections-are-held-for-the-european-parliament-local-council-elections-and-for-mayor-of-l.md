##### Super Thursday
#  Votes are counted on Super Thursday in the UK as elections are held for the European Parliament, local council elections and for Mayor of London and the London Assembly. The local council elections show major losses for the Labour Party, attributed by Labour to protest voting over the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
