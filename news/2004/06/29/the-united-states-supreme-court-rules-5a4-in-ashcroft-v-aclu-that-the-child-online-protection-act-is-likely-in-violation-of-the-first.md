##### United States Supreme Court
#  The United States Supreme Court rules 5-4 in "Ashcroft v. ACLU" that the Child Online Protection Act is likely in violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. The case will be reheard at a lower court. 

The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that a law meant to punish pornographers who peddle dirty pictures to Web-surfing kids is probably an unconstitutional muzzle on free speech.
