##### Supreme Court of the United States
#  The Supreme Court of the United States overturns a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling ("Newdow v. United States Congress") that would have removed the phrase "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance by an 8-0 ruling that the father cannot file a complaint on behalf of his noncustodial daughter.
