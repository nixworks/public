##### Nightline
#  U.S. newscast "Nightline" is taken off the air by several stations owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group because of its planned airing of a list of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq. Sinclair claims it is a political ploy, while network ABC says it is meant as "an expression of respect which simply seeks to honor those who have laid down their lives for this country.
