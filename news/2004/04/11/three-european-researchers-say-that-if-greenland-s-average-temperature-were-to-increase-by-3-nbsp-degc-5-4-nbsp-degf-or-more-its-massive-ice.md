##### Greenland
#  Three European researchers say that if Greenland's average temperature were to increase by 3&nbsp;C (5.4&nbsp;F) or more, its massive ice sheet would melt, gradually swamping coastal communities as seas rise 7 metres (23 feet) over the next 1,000 years. They hypothesize that the upward trend of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions could cause this.
