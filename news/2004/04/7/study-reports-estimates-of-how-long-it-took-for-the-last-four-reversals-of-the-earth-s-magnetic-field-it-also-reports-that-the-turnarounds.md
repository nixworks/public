##### Earth's magnetic field
#  Study reports estimates of how long it took for the last four reversals of the Earth's magnetic field. It also reports that the turnarounds occur more quickly nearer the equator than at higher latitudes closer to the poles. 

Space.com: A new study pins down how long it takes Earth&#39;s magnetic field to reverse. It also finds that the dramatic turnarounds occur more quickly at lower latitudes, nearer the equator, than at higher latitudes.

The convention was organized by Amal Dorai with help from current and former residents of the MIT living group Pi Tau Zeta. The convention was held at 22:45 EDT at the East Campus Courtyard and in Walker Memorial at MIT. That location is 42.360007 degrees north latitude, 71.087870 degrees west longitude. The spacetime coordinates continue to be publicized prominently and indefinitely, so that future time travelers will be aware and have the opportunity to have attended.[http:--web.mit.edu-adorai-timetraveler]](/news/2005/05/7/the-time-traveler-convention-was-held-at-mit-in-the-hopes-of-making-contact-with-time-travelers-from-the-future-the-convention-was-organi.md) _Context: latitude_
