##### Polish Prime Minister
### [ Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller resigns one day after Poland becomes a member of the European Union. His government was the most unpopular of the nine that have ruled Poland since the fall of the communist regime in 1989.

President Aleksander Kwasniewski announces he will designate Marek Belka, a liberal economist, as new prime minister. ](/news/2004/05/2/polish-prime-minister-leszek-miller-resigns-one-day-after-poland-becomes-a-member-of-the-european-union-his-government-was-the-most-unpopu.md)
