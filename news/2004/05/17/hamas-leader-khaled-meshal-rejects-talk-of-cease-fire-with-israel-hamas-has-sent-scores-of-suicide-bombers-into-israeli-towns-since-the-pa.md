#  Hamas leader Khaled Meshal rejects talk of cease-fire with Israel. Hamas has sent scores of suicide bombers into Israeli towns since the Palestinian uprising began in September 2000, killing hundreds of Israelis. "Our choice is between death and death", he said. "Our people will defend themselves until the last breath. The world left us no other choice."
