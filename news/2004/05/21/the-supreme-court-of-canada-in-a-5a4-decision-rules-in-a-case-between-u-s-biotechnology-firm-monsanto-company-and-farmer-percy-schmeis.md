##### Supreme Court of Canada
#  The Supreme Court of Canada, in a 5-4 decision, rules in a case between U.S. biotechnology firm Monsanto Company and farmer Percy Schmeiser that Monsanto holds a patent on the Roundup Ready gene inserted in its canola seed and can control the use of the plant. The court previously decided that a higher life form, the Harvard mouse, could not be patented.

The treatment, which targets a specific disease-causing mutation, is designed to treat individuals who have two mutated copies of a gene called "RPE65" and consists of a virus injected into the eye loaded with a normal copy of the "RPE65" gene. Further, this technique utilizing adeno-associated virus as a vector may, in the future, be used for the treatment of heart disease and also mutations other than LCA, including some cancers. ](/news/2017/10/12/a-panel-of-external-experts-to-the-u-s-food-and-drug-administration-unanimously-vote-that-the-benefits-of-the-gene-replacement-treatment-ma.md) _Context: gene_
