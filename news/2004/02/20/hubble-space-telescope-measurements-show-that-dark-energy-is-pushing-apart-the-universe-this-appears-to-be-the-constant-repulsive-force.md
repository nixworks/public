#  Hubble Space Telescope measurements show that "Dark energy" is pushing apart the universe; this appears to be the constant, repulsive force that Albert Einstein once predicted. Astronomers announce this as evidence that the theory of the cosmological constant proposed, but later discarded, by Einstein may have been right after all. 

Space.com: Exploding stars further confirm a mysterious dark energy force that appears to dominate the universe.

The event, GW170817, coincided with a short gamma ray burst detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, leading to immediate follow-up observations by the Hubble space telescope and numerous ground-based telescopes. This confirms the theory according to which neutron star mergers are the cause of at least some short gamma-ray bursts. ](/news/2017/10/16/scientists-announce-that-the-ligo-and-virgo-gravitational-wave-observatories-detected-for-the-first-time-gravitational-waves-from-the-merger.md) _Context: Hubble space telescope_
