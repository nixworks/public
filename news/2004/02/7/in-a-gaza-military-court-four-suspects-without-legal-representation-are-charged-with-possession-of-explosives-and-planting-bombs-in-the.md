##### Military judge
#  In a Gaza military court, four suspects, without legal representation, are charged with possession of explosives and planting bombs in the same area as a bombing attack on a United States diplomatic convoy. The suspects are "not" charged with the bombing. The United States last week announced a $5 million reward for information leading to the apprehension of the attackers.
