#  Roman Catholic Pope John Paul&nbsp;II presents Eastern Orthodox Patriarch Bartholomew&nbsp;I with reliquaries containing the bones of 4th-century Patriarchs Gregory Nazianzus and John Chrysostom, brought back to Rome as loot from Constantinople during the Crusades. The ceremony is applauded as a notable gesture of ecumenism between the divided churches.
