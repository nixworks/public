##### Kashmir
#  India proposes to Pakistan that India grant Kashmir a large amount of autonomy, in order to end the state of war between the two countries, but that the current border can not be modified. Pakistan recently proposed that Kashmir be demilitarized, split along ethnic-religious lines and granted independence or transferred to United Nations control.
