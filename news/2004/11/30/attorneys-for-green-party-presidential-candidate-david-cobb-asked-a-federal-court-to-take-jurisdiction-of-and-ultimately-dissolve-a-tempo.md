##### Green Party
#  Attorneys for Green Party presidential candidate David Cobb asked a federal court to take jurisdiction of, and ultimately dissolve, a temporary restraining order issued by a Delaware County, Ohio, judge attempting to prevent Cobb from seeking a recount of the presidential ballots cast in that county. Attorneys representing John Kerry filed papers to join the Cobb-Badnarik Ohio recount case. If the Ohio recount does not begin before the votes are certified, then electors will be chosen before the recount begins.
