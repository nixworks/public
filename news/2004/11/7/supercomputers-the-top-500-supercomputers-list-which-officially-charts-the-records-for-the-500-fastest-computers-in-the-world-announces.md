#  Supercomputers: The Top 500 Supercomputers list, which officially charts the records for the 500 fastest computers in the world, announces IBM's Blue Gene-L prototype as the world's fastest supercomputer. Using the Linpack benchmark, it achieved a record computational speed of 70.72 TFlops, taking the title away from Japan's Earth Simulator (35.86 TFlops) which held the title since June 2002. NASA's Columbia takes second place with 51.87 TFlops.

The aircraft, officially named Quiet Supersonic Transport (QueSST) and dubbed the "Son of Concorde", was proposed by NASA and has just been given the go-ahead by US officials. QueSST could make its maiden voyage in 2021 if all goes according to plan. If so, it will halve the current travel time between London and New York City. ](/news/2018/02/13/a-new-plane-that-would-fly-from-london-to-new-york-city-in-three-hours-has-just-received-crucial-funding-the-aircraft-officially-named-qui.md) _Context: NASA_

The decline in ozone-depleting chemicals, specifically chlorine from chlorofluorocarbon (an effect from the 1980's CFC ban, say the scientists), has resulted in 20 percent less depletion since 2005. ](/news/2018/01/5/nasa-research-published-in-geophysical-research-letters-implies-that-the-ozone-layer-is-starting-to-recover-due-to-man-s-actions-the-de.md) _Context: NASA_
