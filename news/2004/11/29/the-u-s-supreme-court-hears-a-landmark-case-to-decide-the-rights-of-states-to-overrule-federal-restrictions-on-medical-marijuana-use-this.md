##### Supreme Court of the United States
#  The U.S. Supreme Court hears a landmark case to decide the rights of states to overrule federal restrictions on medical marijuana use. This case has important consequences for redefining the separation and limitation of powers between states and the federal government. 

The Supreme Court hears a California case Monday that could become a signature decision of the Rehnquist era.
