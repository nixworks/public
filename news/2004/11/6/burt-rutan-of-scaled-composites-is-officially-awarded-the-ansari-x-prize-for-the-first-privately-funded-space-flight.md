Designed by legendary aerospace designer Burt Rutan and funded by billionaire Paul Allen, the ship was launched from a larger plane and, after igniting its burners, flew 62 mi into space and back down again, an altitude that officially makes test pilot Michael Melvill an astronaut. ](/news/2004/06/21/spaceshipone-the-first-privately-and-commercially-funded-aircraft-spaceplane-designed-for-space-travel-without-funding-from-any-government.md) _Context: Burt Rutan_
