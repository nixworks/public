##### Same-sex marriage in the United States
#  Same-sex marriage in the U.S.: Benton County, Oregon, commissioners, after receiving a letter from state attorney general Hardy Myers, reverse their earlier vote to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples this Wednesday. But, stating they will observe the principle of equal treatment under the law, the commissioners decide that the county will stop issuing "any" marriage licenses until the Oregon Supreme Court has ruled on the constitutionality of the law.
