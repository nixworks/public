##### Guantnamo Bay
#  Four British prisoners who had been arrested on their return from Guantanamo Bay are released without charge. A fifth was not arrested on arrival. A further four remain in the Cuban camp. British newspapers vie for the rights to their stories, with offers in the range of GBP300,000. Compensation lawsuits from the returned five are expected against the US and UK governments.
