##### Lord Carey
#  Lord Carey, former Archbishop of Canterbury, says that Islam is authoritarian, inflexible and under-achieving; and that Muslim countries have contributed little of major significance to the world's culture for centuries, at the same time stating that most Muslims are peace loving people who should not be demonized. He, however, denounces moderates for not unequivocally denouncing the "evil" of suicide bombers. Critics said his critique of Islamic culture amounted to an "attack". 

Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, has launched an attack on Islamic culture, saying it was authoritarian, inflexible and under-achieving.
