##### Rage Against the Machine
# Rage Against the Machine's Tim Commerford is arrested for climbing on the set at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards after his band lost the award for Best Rock Video to Limp Bizkit. The director of Rage's "Sleep Now in the Fire" video, Michael Moore, suggests Commerford was probably "just bored" by the show. Britney Spears performed her hit single "Oops!... I Did It Again", becoming one of the VMA's most iconic and controversial performances due to her skin-coloured outfit. NSYNC performed their hit single "Bye Bye Bye", also becoming one of the VMA's most iconic performances ever.
