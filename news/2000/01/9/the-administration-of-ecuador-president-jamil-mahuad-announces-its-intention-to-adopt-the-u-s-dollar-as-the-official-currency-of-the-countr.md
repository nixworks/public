# The administration of Ecuador president Jamil Mahuad announces its intention to adopt the U.S. dollar as the official currency of the country to address the ongoing economic crisis. Subsequent protest led to the 2000 Ecuadorian coup d'tat which saw Mahuad's removal from office and the elevation of Vice President Gustavo Noboa to the presidency.
