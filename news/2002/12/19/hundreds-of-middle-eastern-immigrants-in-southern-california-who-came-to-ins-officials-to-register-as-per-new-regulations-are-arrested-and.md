##### Southern California
# Hundreds of Middle Eastern immigrants in Southern California who came to INS officials to register, as per new regulations, are arrested and imprisoned for various INS violations, many of them due to official delays in processing necessary forms. Critics compared the action to the Japanese internment in the same region during World War&nbsp;II. Others claimed that the people are in violation of United States immigration law, and the arrests are valid.
