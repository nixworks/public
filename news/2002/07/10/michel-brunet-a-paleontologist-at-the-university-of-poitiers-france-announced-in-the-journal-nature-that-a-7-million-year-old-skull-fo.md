##### Michel Brunet
#  Michel Brunet, a paleontologist at the University of Poitiers, France, announced in the journal "Nature" that a 7-million-year-old skull found in the desert of Chad is the earliest hominid fossil ever found. But he was immediately met by a firestorm of criticism from other scientists who claim that it is merely the skull of an ape, possibly a proto-gorilla.
