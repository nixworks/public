# European Union lawmakers strike a deal on opening up 26 and 3.6 GHz bandwidth, by 2020, for a period of 20 years. In the United States, Congress leaders agree to vote a bill on March 6 timetabling the auction of 28 GHz spectrum, starting in November. 

EU countries and lawmakers have struck a deal to free up radio frequencies for next-generation 5G services that will be valid for 20 years, as the bloc tries to catch up with the United States and China in rolling out internet-connected products.
