# The United States permanently downgrades their embassy in Havana, making its status 'unaccompanied', meaning a post at which no family members are permitted to reside. The status change comes after alleged health attacks. 

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson maintains his decision to reduce the diplomatic presence in Havana due to the inexplicable symptoms suffered by at least 24 American victims.
