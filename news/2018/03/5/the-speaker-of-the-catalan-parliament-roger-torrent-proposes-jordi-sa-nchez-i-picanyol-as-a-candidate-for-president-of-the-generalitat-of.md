##### 2017-18 Spanish constitutional crisis
# The Speaker of the Catalan Parliament, Roger Torrent, proposes Jordi Sanchez i Picanyol as a candidate for President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, but he has been preventively jailed since 16 October 2017, accused of sedition. This happens after Carles Puigdemont resigns as a possible candidate, who, if elected, would have been a symbolic president with a symbolic government in Brussels. The candidacy of Sanchez also reportedly lacks one seat for a majority.
