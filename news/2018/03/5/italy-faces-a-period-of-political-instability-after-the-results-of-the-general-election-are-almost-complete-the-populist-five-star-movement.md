##### Italian general election, 2018
# Italy faces a period of political instability after the results of the general election are almost complete. The populist Five Star Movement (M5S) is projected to be the largest party in the Italian Parliament with 32% of the vote. The party has long stated its hostility towards forming a coalition government. 

Italy entered a period of political instability after national elections boosted populists but failed to produce a winner with enough support to patch together a parliamentary majority.
