ADDIS ABABA: At least 38 people, mostly students, were killed when a bus plunged into a ravine in Ethiopia&#039;s mountainous north on Monday, police said. Ten people survived the crash that took place in the Amhara region, police commander Mohammed Ahmed said. &#034;The majority of victims were students,&#034; he told Amhara Mass Media Agency.
