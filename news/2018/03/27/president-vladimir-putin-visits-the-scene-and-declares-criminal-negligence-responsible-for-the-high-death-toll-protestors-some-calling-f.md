##### 2018 Kemerovo fire
# President Vladimir Putin visits the scene and declares "criminal negligence" responsible for the high death toll. Protestors, some calling for Putin's resignation, demonstrate outside the local government headquarters. 

At least 64 people - 41 of them children - died in a shopping mall fire and many are feared missing.
