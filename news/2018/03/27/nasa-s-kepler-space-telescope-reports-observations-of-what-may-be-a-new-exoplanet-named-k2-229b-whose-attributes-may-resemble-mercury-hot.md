##### Discoveries of exoplanets
# NASA's Kepler Space Telescope reports observations of what may be a new exoplanet named K2-229b, whose attributes may resemble Mercury (hot, metallic, and dense). 

The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, revealed on Monday the discovery of an exoplanet resembling Mercury. The new finding made by the NASA Kepler Space Telescope will help toâ€¦
