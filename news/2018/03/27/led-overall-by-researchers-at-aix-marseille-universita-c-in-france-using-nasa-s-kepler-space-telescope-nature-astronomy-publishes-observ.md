##### Discoveries of exoplanets
# Led overall by researchers at Aix-Marseille Universite in France using NASA's "Kepler Space Telescope", "Nature Astronomy" publishes observations of what may be a new exoplanet named K2-229b, whose attributes may resemble the planet of Mercury (hot, metallic, and dense). 

The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, revealed on Monday the discovery of an exoplanet resembling Mercury. The new finding made by the NASA Kepler Space Telescope will help toâ€¦
