# A Dutch court rules police are liable for a mass shooting at a shopping centre that killed 6 and wounded 16 because the gunman should not have been issued a firearms licence. 

A court orders police to compensate the families of those killed and injured when a gunman opened fire in a shopping mall in 2011.
