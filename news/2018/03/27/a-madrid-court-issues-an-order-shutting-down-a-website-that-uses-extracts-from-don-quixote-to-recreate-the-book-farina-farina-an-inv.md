##### Censorship in Spain
# A Madrid court issues an order shutting down a website that uses extracts from "Don Quixote" to recreate the book "Farina". "Farina", an investigation of drug trafficking, is the subject of a freedom of speech debate after a court halted sales ahead of a libel case. 

A book about Spain&rsquo;s drug-smuggling underworld banned last week by a Madrid court has been brought to readers online as a cut-and-pasted text from Spanish classic Don Quixote.
