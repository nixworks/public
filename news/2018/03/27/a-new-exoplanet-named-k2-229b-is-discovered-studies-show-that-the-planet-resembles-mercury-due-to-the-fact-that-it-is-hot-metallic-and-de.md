##### Discoveries of exoplanets
# A new exoplanet named K2-229b is discovered. Studies show that the planet resembles Mercury due to the fact that it is hot, metallic, and dense. 

The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, revealed on Monday the discovery of an exoplanet resembling Mercury. The new finding made by the NASA Kepler Space Telescope will help to…
