#  A Senate Intelligence Committee report says that a House Intelligence Committee Republican was behind the leak to Fox News of private text messages between a Russian-connected lawyer and Senator Mark Warner, the committee vice-chairman. Committee chairman Richard Burr denies this information, first published by the "The New York Times". 

In an extraordinary confrontation, the bipartisan leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee told the House speaker that his troops had leaked a senatorâ€™s texts with a Russia-connected lawyer.
