##### Discoveries of exoplanets
# NASA astronomers use the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes in research implying that "hot Saturn" (high surface-atmosphere temperatures and gas giant-mass) exoplanet WASP-39b, located 700 light-years from Earth, has a large amount of water molecules in its atmosphere. 

Scientists used NASA&#039;s Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes to find water &quot;fingerprints&quot; in the atmosphere of a hot, bloated, Saturn-mass exoplanet some 700 light-years away.
