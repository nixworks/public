# Poland's ruling Law and Justice proposes changes to planned judicial reforms in response to European Union criticisms the plans threaten judicial independence. The European Commission is threatening Poland with sanctions over the reforms. 

The opposition dismissed the changes as &quot;a lie&quot; and warned the EU against accepting the &quot;cosmetic changes.&quot; The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party had resisted any concessions for months before Thursday&#39;s announcement.
