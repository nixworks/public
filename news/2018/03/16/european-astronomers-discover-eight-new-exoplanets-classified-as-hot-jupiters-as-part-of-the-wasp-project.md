# European astronomers discover eight new exoplanets classified as Hot Jupiters as part of the WASP project. 

A team of European astronomers claims to have discovered eight new exoplanets - hot Jupiters - as part of the WASP project. The newly discovered gas giants have short orbital periods and masses ranging from
