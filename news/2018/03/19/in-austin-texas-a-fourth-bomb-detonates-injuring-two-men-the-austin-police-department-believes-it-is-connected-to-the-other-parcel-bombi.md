# In Austin, Texas, a fourth bomb detonates, injuring two men. The Austin Police Department believes it is connected to the other parcel bombings, but do not believe it to be connected to the bomb threat leveled at the SXSW festival. 

Austin police say the explosion, following deadly parcel bombings, may have been tripwire-activated.
