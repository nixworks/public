##### Russia-European Union relations
# Donald Tusk announces EU nations have asked 30 Russian diplomats to leave. Germany, France, Poland and Ukraine are among the nations to expel diplomats. 

The United States is among 18 countries to expel Russian diplomats over the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. A total of 60 Russian officials will be forced to leave the US while Moscow&amp;#39;s consulate in Seattle will also be closed, the White House announced on Monday. Germany, France, Canada and Ukraine were all confirmed as being among the nations to take similar measures. The move is a concerted response to the attempted assassination of Mr Skripal and alleged Russian involvement - to which Russian has reacted with renewed outrage. Announcing its measures, the White House said the 60 affected people included 48 members of the Russian embassy and 12 &quot;spies&quot; working under diplomatic cover. A State Department spokesperson said: &quot;The Salisbury attack was only the latest in a long series of Russian efforts to undermine international peace and stability. &quot;Russia has shown malicious contempt for the sovereignty and security of countries worldwide. It has repeatedly sought to subvert and discredit Western institutions. &quot;Today we stand in solidarity with America&amp;#39;s closest ally, the United Kingdom.&quot;
