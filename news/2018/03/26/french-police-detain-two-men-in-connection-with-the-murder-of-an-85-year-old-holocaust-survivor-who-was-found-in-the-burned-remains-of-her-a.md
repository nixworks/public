# French police detain two men in connection with the murder of an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor who was found in the burned remains of her apartment. The prosecutor's office is investigating if the killing was "motivated by the real or supposed adherence to a religion". 

French police are investigating whether the death of an elderly Jewish woman stabbed and burnt to death in her Paris apartment last week was an anti-Semitic murder, a judicial source said on Monday.
