##### Antiguan general election, 2018
# Voters in Antigua and Barbuda go to the polls, with Barbudan residents having to travel to Antigua in order to participate. 

Barbudans have for the first time in their history been forced to travel by fishing boat, ferry and charter plane to neighbouring Antigua to vote in their elections &ndash; a move many on the hurricane-ravaged island see as a ploy to discourage them from voting.
