##### Discoveries of exoplanets
# Fifteen new exoplanets are discovered. Three of them, larger than Earth, are also discovered around the dwarf star K2-155. Furthermore, a 3D climate simulation was created to find out if K2-155d has water. 

Recently, the researchers have discovered 15 new planets in the Universe. They are found around some cool stars called ‘red dwarfs’. What’s even more amazing is the fact that one of these exoplanet…
