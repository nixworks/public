# Scientists discover a big colony of the more than 750,000 pairs of Adelie penguins on the Danger Islands in Antarctica. 

More than 1 million penguins who&#039;ve been hiding in a remote part of Antarctica were recently discovered thanks to images taken from space and ... their own poop. A study in the Scientific Reports journal reveals the Danger Islands find of more than 750,000 pairs of Adélie penguins—a discovery researchers are calling a &quot;total surprise,&quot; per the BBC.
