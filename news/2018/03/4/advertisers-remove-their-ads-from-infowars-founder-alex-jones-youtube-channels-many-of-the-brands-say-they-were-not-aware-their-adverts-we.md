# Advertisers remove their ads from InfoWars founder Alex Jones' YouTube channels. Many of the brands say they were not aware their adverts were being shown on the channel until being contacted by CNN. 

Several leading brands have reportedly sought to pull their ads from YouTube channels of the far-right conspiracy site InfoWars. Ads from a number of major firms and organisations - including Nike, 20th Century Fox, Expedia, the Mormon Church, Alibaba and the National Rifle Association - were being displayed on Infowars&#039; channels on the video sharing platform, according to CNN.
