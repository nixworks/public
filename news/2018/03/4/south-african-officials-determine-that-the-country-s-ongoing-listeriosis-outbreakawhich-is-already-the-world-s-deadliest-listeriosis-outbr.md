##### 2017-18 South African listeriosis outbreak
# South African officials determine that the country's ongoing listeriosis outbreak--which is already the world's deadliest listeriosis outbreak, killing over 180 people and sickening 1,000 more--was caused by contaminated "Polony" processed meat. The Ministry of Health issues a recall of contaminated products from RCL Foods and from Tiger Brands subsidiary company Enterprise Food and advises the public to avoid all processed meat products that are sold as ready-to-eat.
