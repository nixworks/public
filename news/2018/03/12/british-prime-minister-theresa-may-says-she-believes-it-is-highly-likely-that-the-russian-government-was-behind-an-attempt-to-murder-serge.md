##### Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal
# British Prime Minister Theresa May says she believes it is "highly likely" that the Russian government was behind an attempt to murder Sergei Skripal and his daughter using a Novichok agent. 

British PM Theresa May told Parliament that a Russian-produced nerve agent had been used to poison Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury. The US has said those responsible should face &quot;serious consequences.&quot;
