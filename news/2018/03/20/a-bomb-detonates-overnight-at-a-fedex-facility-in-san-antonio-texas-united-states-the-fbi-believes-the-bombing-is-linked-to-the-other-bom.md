##### Austin serial bombings
# A bomb detonates overnight at a FedEx facility in San Antonio, Texas, United States. The FBI believes the bombing is linked to the other bombings in the area. The ATF reports that there were no serious injuries. Both the bomb's point of origin and intended destination were in Austin. 

The package blew up on a conveyor belt, and law enforcement investigated a second suspicious package in the FedEx system. Austin police received 1,257 calls about suspicious packages in the last week.
