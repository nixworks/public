# A rocket fired from rebel-held Eastern Ghouta strikes a popular market in Damascus, killing at least 29 people, according to Syrian state TV SANA. 

AMMAN: At least 29 people were killed and scores injured on Tuesday when a rocket landed in a busy market place in an eastern suburb of the Syrian capital Damascus, state media said. The rocket landed in the Kashkoul market close to rebel-held parts of Eastern Ghouta, which has been under heavy bombardment by the Syrian army and its allies since last month. State media gave no further details. (Reporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; Editing by Gareth Jones)
