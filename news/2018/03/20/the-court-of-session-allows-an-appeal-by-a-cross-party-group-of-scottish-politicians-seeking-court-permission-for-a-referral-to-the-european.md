##### Brexit negotiations
# The Court of Session allows an appeal by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians seeking court permission for a referral to the European Court of Justice. The group wish for a ruling that the UK can abandon Brexit without permission from the European Union's other member states. A lower court will examine the claim. 

Major victory for cross-party group as appeal judges say case raises point ‘of great importance’
