# Two men are rescued from a capsized dredger off Malaysia after 50 hours in an air pocket in the engine room. The death toll so far is nine, with rescue efforts underway to search for more survivors. 

Rescuers heard knocking sounds and found the sailors in the ship&#039;s engine room, and officials say an air pocket kept them alive.
