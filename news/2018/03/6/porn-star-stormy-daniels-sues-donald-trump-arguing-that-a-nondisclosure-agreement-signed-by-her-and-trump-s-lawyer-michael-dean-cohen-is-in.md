# Porn star Stormy Daniels sues Donald Trump, arguing that a nondisclosure agreement signed by her and Trump's lawyer Michael Dean Cohen is invalid. 

The adult film star says a 2016 agreement not to discuss their alleged &quot;intimate&quot; relationship is not valid because then-candidate Trump never signed it.
