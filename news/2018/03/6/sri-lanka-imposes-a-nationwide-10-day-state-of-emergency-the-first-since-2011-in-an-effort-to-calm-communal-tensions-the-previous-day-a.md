##### 2018 anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka
# Sri Lanka imposes a nationwide 10-day state of emergency, the first since 2011, in an effort to calm communal tensions. The previous day, a Sinhalese Buddhist mob attack on Sri Lankan Muslim shops in the region of Kandy, Central Province, left a Muslim person dead. 

Sri Lanka declared a nationwide state of emergency for 10 days on Tuesday to stop the spread of communal violence, a government spokesman said, after clashes erupted between majority Buddhists and members of the minority Muslim community.
