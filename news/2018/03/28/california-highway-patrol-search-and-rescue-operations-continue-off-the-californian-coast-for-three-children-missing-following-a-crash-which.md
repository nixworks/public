# California Highway Patrol search and rescue operations continue off the Californian coast for three children missing following a crash which killed five of their relatives. Their car drove out of a seaside unbarricaded parking lot and off of a 75-foot cliff into the sea on March 26. 

It&#39;s not clear if the children were in the SUV crash that left five other family members dead, but a search is on as part of the ongoing investigation.
