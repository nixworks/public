##### Giant-impact hypothesis
# Research published in the journal "Science Advances" implies the Earth may have had water earlier than thought, and that terrestrial water could have survived the impact that created the Moon, the event which was previously hypothesised to be responsible for our planet's water. 

Comparing moon rocks to volcanic ones from the ocean floor shows that Earthâ€™s water may have stuck around even through the giant impact that formed the moon
