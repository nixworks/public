# A court in Quebec City accepts guilty pleas to six murders and six attempted murders tendered by Alexandre Bissonnette on Monday and lifts restrictions on reporting the pleas after he passes a psychiatric evaluation. The charges relate to a 2017 Islamophobic shooting at a mosque that Justin Trudeau described as a terrorist attack.
