# European astronomers observe the birth of a symbiotic X-ray binary from the Galactic Center using INTEGRAL space telescope. 

 ESA’s Integral space observatory has witnessed a rare event: the moment that winds emitted by a swollen red giant star revived its slow-spinning companion, the core of a dead star, bringing it back to life in a flash of X-rays.
