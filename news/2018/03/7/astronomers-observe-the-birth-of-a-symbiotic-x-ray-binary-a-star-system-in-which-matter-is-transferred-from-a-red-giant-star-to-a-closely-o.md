##### Neutron stars
# Astronomers observe the birth of a symbiotic X-ray binary, a star system in which matter is transferred from a red giant star to a closely orbiting neutron star (the remnant of a star gone supernova), forming an accretion disk and shining brightly in the X-ray. The object, IGR J17329-2731, flared brightly in the X-rays for the first time in August 2017. Further study showed it to be a symbiotic X-ray binary, suspected to be flaring for the first time, the neutron star being thus "brought back to life" by the red giant. 

Astronomers discovered an unusual moment in the birth of a rare binary star system, made up of a red giant star and a neutron star.
