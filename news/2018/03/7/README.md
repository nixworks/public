##### Astronomy
### [Astronomers observe the birth of a symbiotic X-ray binary, a star system in which matter is transferred from a red giant star to a closely orbiting neutron star (the remnant of a star gone supernova), forming an accretion disk and shining brightly in the X-ray. The object, IGR J17329-2731, flared brightly in the X-rays in August 2017. Further study showed it to be a symbiotic X-ray binary, suspected to be flaring for the first time, the neutron star being thus "brought back to life" by the red giant. ](/news/2018/03/7/astronomers-observe-the-birth-of-a-symbiotic-x-ray-binary-a-star-system-in-which-matter-is-transferred-from-a-red-giant-star-to-a-closely-o.md)
