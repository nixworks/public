# European Astronomers observe the birth of a symbiotic X-ray binary from the Galactic Center. 

 ESAâ€™s Integral space observatory has witnessed a rare event: the moment that winds emitted by a swollen red giant star revived its slow-spinning companion, the core of a dead star, bringing it back to life in a flash of X-rays.
