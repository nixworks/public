# The Parliament of Catalonia opens the new legislature. Roger Torrent (ERC) is named Speaker. Three parlementarians in exile vote through proxies, the five parlementarians in exile in Belgium do not. Carles Puigdemont (PDeCAT, JuntsxCat), through his spokesman, considers it "perfectly plausible" for him to be president remotely. 

The choice of Roger Torrent is the first step to reinstating local government.
