# Senior General Min Aung Hlaing posts on Facebook that Myanmar Army troops and Rakhine State villagers killed 10 Rohingya Muslims whose bodies were found in a mass grave in Inn Din village. This is the first time Myanmar's military has officially acknowledged extrajudicial actions against the Rohingya. Fortify Rights chief executive officer Matthew Smith says the two Reuters journalists who have been jailed since December 12, 2017, were investigating the same mass grave referenced by Min Aung Hlaing. 

One of the biggest questions in the Rohingya crisis: Where are the bodies?
