# An 7.9 magnitude earthquake occurs in the Gulf of Alaska. A tsunami warning was issued for coastal Alaska through Canada's British Columbia, and the U.S. West Coast, from the Washington state--Canadian border to the Mexican border, was under a tsunami watch. Areas of Alaska remain under a tsunami advisory. It is tied as the sixth-largest earthquake ever recorded in the United States, but there are no reports of significant damage or fatalities. 

Only four earthquakes with a greater magnitude have ever been recorded in the US, all of which caused a tsunami.
