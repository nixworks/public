# An 7.9 magnitude earthquake occurs in the Gulf of Alaska. There is a tsunami warning for coastal Alaska through Canada's British Columbia. The U.S. West Coast, from the Washington state--Canadian border to the Mexican border, is under a tsunami watch. It is the fifth largest earthquake in the history of the United States. 

Only four earthquakes with a greater magnitude have ever been recorded in the US, all of which caused a tsunami.
