# At least 15 people are killed by mudslides following heavy overnight rains in areas of Santa Barbara County, California, where last month's wildfires destroyed forests and destabilized the land. 

MONTECITO, Calif. (AP) - At least 13 people were killed and dozens of homes were swept away or heavily damaged Tuesday as downpours sent mud and boulders roaring down hills stripped of vegetation by a gigantic wildfire that raged in Southern California last month. Helicopters were used to pluck more than 50 people from rooftops because downed trees and power lines blocked roads, and dozens more were rescued on the ground, including a mud-caked 14-year-old girl pulled from a collapsed Montecito home where she had been trapped for hours. &quot;I thought I was dead for a minute there,&quot; the dazed girl could be heard saying on video posted by KNBC-TV before she was taken away on a stretcher.
