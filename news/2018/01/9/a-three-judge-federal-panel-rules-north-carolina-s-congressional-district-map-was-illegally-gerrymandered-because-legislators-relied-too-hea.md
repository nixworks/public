##### Gerrymandering in the United States
# A three-judge federal panel rules North Carolina's congressional district map was illegally gerrymandered because legislators relied too heavily on partisan affiliation in drawing constituencies. This is the first time a federal court has struck down a redistricting plan for partisan gerrymandering. 

The federal judges gave lawmakers until Jan. 29 to show them a new map. The deadline is important because candidates for the November congressional elections begin filing for the primaries on Feb. 12.
