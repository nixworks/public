# President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan says the Afrin offensive, as announced, is now to turn east, towards Manbij and the border with Iraq. 

President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday Turkish forces would sweep Kurdish fighters from the Syrian border and could push all the way east to the frontier with Iraq -- a move which risks a possible confrontation with U.S. forces allied to the Kurds.
