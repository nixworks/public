##### Ozone depletion
# NASA research, published in "Geophysical Research Letters", implies that the ozone layer is starting to recover due to man's actions. The decline in ozone-depleting chemicals, specifically chlorine from chlorofluorocarbon (an effect from the 1980's CFC ban, say the scientists), has resulted in 20 percent less depletion since 2005.
