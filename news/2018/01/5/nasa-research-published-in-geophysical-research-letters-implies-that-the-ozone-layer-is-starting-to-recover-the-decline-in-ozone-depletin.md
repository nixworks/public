# NASA research published in "Geophysical Research Letters" implies that the ozone layer is starting to recover. The decline in ozone-depleting chemicals, specifically chlorine from chlorofluorocarbon (an effect from the 1980's CFC ban, say the scientists), has resulted in 20 percent less depletion since 2005.
