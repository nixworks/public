# In a world's first, a drone rescues two people off the coast of Lennox Head, New South Wales in Australia. John Barilaro, the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, praises the rescue as historic. 

A pair of Australian swimmers on Thursday became the first people to be rescued in the ocean by a drone when the aerial lifesaver dropped an safety device to distressed teens caught in rough seas.
