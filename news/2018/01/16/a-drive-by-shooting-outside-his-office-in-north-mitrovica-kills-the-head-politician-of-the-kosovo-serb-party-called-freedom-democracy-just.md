# A drive-by shooting outside his office in North Mitrovica kills the head politician of the Kosovo Serb party called Freedom, Democracy, Justice, Oliver Ivanovic. In January 2016, European Union judges in Kosovo sentenced him to nine years, but the verdict was overturned by an appeals court a year later. He was facing a retrial for alleged war crimes against ethnic Albanians committed in 1999. 

Several shots were fired at Oliver Ivanovic outside his office in the northern city of Mitrovica.
