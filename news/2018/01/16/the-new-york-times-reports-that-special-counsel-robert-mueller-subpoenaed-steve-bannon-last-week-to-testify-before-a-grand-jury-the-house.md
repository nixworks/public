##### Special Counsel investigation
# "The New York Times" reports that Special Counsel Robert Mueller subpoenaed Steve Bannon last week to testify before a grand jury.

A House committee issued a subpoena to the former chief White House strategist after he said the White House asked him not to answer questions about his tenure.
