# Nabil Shaath, the foreign affairs adviser of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, says that the Palestinian Central Council freezes its recognition of the state of Israel until Israel recognizes Palestine as a state. Palestine will freeze the Oslo accords. 

A US move to recognise Jerusalem as Israel&#39;s capital would mean the end of President Donald Trump&#39;s peace efforts on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a senior Palestinian official warned Tuesday.
