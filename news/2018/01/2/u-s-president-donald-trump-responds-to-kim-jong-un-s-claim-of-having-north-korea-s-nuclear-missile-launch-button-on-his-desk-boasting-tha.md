##### North Korea-United States relations
#  U.S. President Donald Trump responds to Kim Jong-un's claim of having North Korea's nuclear missile launch button on his desk, boasting that the size of the nuclear missile launch button on his own desk is larger and more powerful than Kim's. 

The president’s tweet that he has a “much bigger” arsenal of nuclear weapons was met with dread and humor, of both the gallows and locker-room varieties.
