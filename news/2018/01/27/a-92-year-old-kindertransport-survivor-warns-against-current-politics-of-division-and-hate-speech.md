# A 92-year old Kindertransport survivor warns against current politics of division and hate speech. 

A 92-year-old Kindertransport survivor has issued an urgent call to put a stop to the politics of division before it’s too late, warning that the world has “learnt nothing” from the atrocities committed in Nazi Germany. Speaking ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day, Austrian-born Harry Bibring, who arrived in Britain on the Kindertransport in 1939, said he was deeply “concerned” about the state of the world and feared for the future of his great-grandsons.
