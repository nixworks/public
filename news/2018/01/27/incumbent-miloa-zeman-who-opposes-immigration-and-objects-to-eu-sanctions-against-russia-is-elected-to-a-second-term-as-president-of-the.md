# Incumbent Milos Zeman, who opposes immigration and objects to EU sanctions against Russia, is elected to a second term as President of the Czech Republic after receiving 51.8 percent of the votes in the run-off election over pro-EU challenger Jiri Drahos. 

The two-day vote pits the pro-Russia, anti-immigration president against a pro-EU academic.
