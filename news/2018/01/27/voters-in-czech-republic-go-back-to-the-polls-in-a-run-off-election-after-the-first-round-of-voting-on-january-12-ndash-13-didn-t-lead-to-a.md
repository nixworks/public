# Voters in Czech Republic go back to the polls in a run-off election after the first round of voting on January 12&ndash;13 didn't lead to a majority. Pro-Russia incumbent Milos Zeman faces pro-EU challenger Jiri Drahos. 

The two-day vote pits the pro-Russia, anti-immigration president against a pro-EU academic.
