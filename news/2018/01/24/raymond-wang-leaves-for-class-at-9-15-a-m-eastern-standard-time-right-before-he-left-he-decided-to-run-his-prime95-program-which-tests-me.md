# Raymond Wang leaves for class at 9:15 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. Right before he left, he decided to run his Prime95 program which tests Mersenne numbers, but when he came home at 1:26 p.m., he saw his house lost power so his program did no iterations in those four hours. Therefore 13:27:56 was not at all a joyful second. That second was a pile of shit, too.
