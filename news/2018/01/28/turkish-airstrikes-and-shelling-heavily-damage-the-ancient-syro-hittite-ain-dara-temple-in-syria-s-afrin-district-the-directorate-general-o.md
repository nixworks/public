##### Turkish military operation in Afrin
# Turkish airstrikes and shelling heavily damage the ancient Syro-Hittite Ain Dara temple in Syria's Afrin District. The Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums calls on the international community to pressure Turkey "to prevent the targeting of archaeological and cultural sites". 

The Syrian government and a war monitor said on Sunday that Turkish shelling of the Kurdish-held Afrin region of Syria had seriously damaged an ancient temple.
