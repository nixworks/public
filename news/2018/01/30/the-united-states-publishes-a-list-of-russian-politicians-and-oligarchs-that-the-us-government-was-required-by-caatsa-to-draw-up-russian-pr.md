# The United States publishes a list of Russian politicians and oligarchs that the US government was required by CAATSA to draw up; Russian President Vladimir Putin says that the list is an unfriendly act that complicates ties between the two countries. 

The list of top Russians was required by a US sanctions law but no new measures are announced.
