# The United States publishes a list of Russian politicians and oligarchs that the U.S. government was required by CAATSA to draw up. Russian President Vladimir Putin says that the list is an "unfriendly act" that complicates ties between the two countries. 

The list of top Russians was required by a US sanctions law but no new measures are announced.
