# Rocket Lab successfully launches test rocket Electron into orbit from Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand, becoming the first rocket to reach orbit using an electric-pump-fed engine, after the original rocket launch in May 2017 had to be aborted by safety officials. 

The rocket was launched from the Mahia Peninsula this afternoon.
