# Gunmen kill 6 people in the 13-hour gun battle. The Afghan Interior Ministry says that the siege ended when the last gunman was shot dead. NATO reports that "no foreign troops" died. The Taliban claim that they deployed 5 suicide bombers armed with hand grenades and AK-47 assault rifles. 

At least fourteen foreigners and four Afghans were killed after gunmen attacked the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said.
