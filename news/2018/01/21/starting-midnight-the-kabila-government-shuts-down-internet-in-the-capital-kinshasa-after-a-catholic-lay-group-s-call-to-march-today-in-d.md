# Starting midnight, the Kabila government shuts down Internet in the capital Kinshasa, after a Catholic lay group's call to march today, in defiance of a government ban on all manifestations. 

At least three people were killed when Congolese security forces fired tear gas and live bullets to disperse a protest against President Joseph Kabila organized by the Catholic church on Sunday, a local watchdog said.
