# The U.S. government's highly classified Zuma satellite is reportedly lost after being launched by SpaceX on a Falcon 9 Full Thrust rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Northrop Grumman, who built the satellite, and SpaceX have both refused to confirm the mission's failure due to its classified nature. 

Dow Jones reported that federal lawmakers had been briefed about the apparent destruction of the secretive payload &mdash; code-named Zuma.
