# Mario Draghi, the President of the European Central Bank, says that Mnuchin's comments are contrary to a decades-old agreement not to "target" each other's exchange rate. The European Central Bank keeps its policy unchanged for now. 

European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi took a swipe at Washington on Thursday for talking down the dollar, a move he said threatened a decades-old pact not to target the currency and might force his bank to change its own policy.
