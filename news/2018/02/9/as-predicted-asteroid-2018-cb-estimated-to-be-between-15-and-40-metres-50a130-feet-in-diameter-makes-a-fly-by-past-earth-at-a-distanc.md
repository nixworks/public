##### Asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2018
# As predicted, asteroid 2018 CB, estimated to be between 15 and 40 metres (50-130 feet) in diameter, makes a fly-by past Earth at a distance of around 64,500 km (40,100 mi). This is the second asteroid to make a fly-by this week. 

The space rock 2018 CB is up to 40m long and will come within 64,000km of the planet’s surface
