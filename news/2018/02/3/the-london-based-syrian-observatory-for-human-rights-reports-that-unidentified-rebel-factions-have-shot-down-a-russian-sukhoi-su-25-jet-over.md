##### Syrian Civil War
# The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports that unidentified rebel factions have shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-25 jet over the Idlib Governorate, near Maarrat al-Nu'man, also killing its pilot. The pilot had escaped with his parachute but was killed on the ground while he fought with a pistol to evade capture. No groups claim responsibility. Russia's Ministry of Defence corroborates this version of events. 

Syrian rebels have shot down a Russian jet over Idlib province and captured its pilot, according to a monitor. Syrian troops, backed by Russian air support, launched an offensive on rebel-held Idlib back in December.
