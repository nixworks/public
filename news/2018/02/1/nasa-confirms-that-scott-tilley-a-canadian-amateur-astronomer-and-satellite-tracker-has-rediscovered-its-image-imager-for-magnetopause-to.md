# NASA confirms that Scott Tilley, a Canadian amateur astronomer and satellite tracker, has rediscovered its IMAGE (Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration) satellite while he was searching for the U.S. government's classified Zuma satellite. NASA engineers will try to analyze the data from the spacecraft to learn more about the state of the spacecraft. 

An amateur astronomer rediscovered a Nasa satellite which has been lost in space for more than a decade. Scott Tilley was scanning the skies in search of a secret US government spy satellite launched by Elon Muskâ€™s SpaceX when he found signals from the long-lost satellite called the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (Image).
