##### Syrian Civil War
# Syria and the Russian Federation once again state that the United States' military presence in Syria is "illegal". United States and US-backed forces now have control of about a quarter of Syrian territory. 

The overnight clash came after pro-government forces attacked a U.S.-backed base in the eastern Syrian desert, prompting the U.S. to retaliate in &ldquo;self defense.&rdquo;
