##### Nunes memo
# United States president Donald Trump authorizes congress to release the Nunes memo against the wishes of the FBI, DOJ, and some bipartisan lawmakers that say it poses a national security risk. 

The president got into step with Republican allies who have spent months attacking what they call bias in the FBI and Justice Department. Critics warn this situation is perilous.
