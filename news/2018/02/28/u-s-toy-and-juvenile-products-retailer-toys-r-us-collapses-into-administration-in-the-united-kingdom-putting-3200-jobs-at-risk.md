# U.S. toy and juvenile-products retailer Toys "R" Us collapses into administration in the United Kingdom, putting 3200 jobs at risk. 

Two of the UK’s best-known retailers collapsed into administration on Wednesday, putting well over 5,000 jobs at risk and underscoring the pressures stemming from inflation, slumping consumer confidence and the surging popularity of internet shopping. Toys R Us, which had reportedly been wrangling with creditors for weeks, announced that it had appointed Moorfields to handle its wind-down, casting doubt over the future of 3,200 employees’ work.
