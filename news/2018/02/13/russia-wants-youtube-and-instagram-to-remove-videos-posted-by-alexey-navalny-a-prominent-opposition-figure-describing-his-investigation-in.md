##### Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections
# Russia wants YouTube and Instagram to remove videos posted by Alexey Navalny, a prominent opposition figure, describing his investigation into Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire with bribing Sergey Prikhodko, Russia's deputy prime minister, and offering information about the 2016 U.S. election he had received from Paul Manafort.
