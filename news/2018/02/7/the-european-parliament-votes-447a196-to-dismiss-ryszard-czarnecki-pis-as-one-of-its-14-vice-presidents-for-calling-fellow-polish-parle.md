##### Politics of the European Union
# The European Parliament votes 447-196 to dismiss Ryszard Czarnecki (PiS) as one of its 14 vice-presidents, for calling fellow Polish parlementarian Roza Thun (Civic Platform) a "szmalcownik" (meaning Nazi collaborator). It is the first time that the parliament invokes the powers of Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union to dismiss a senior office holder. Czarnecki remains a Member of the European Parliament. 

The European Parliament has voted overwhelmingly to dismiss one of its vice presidents. Ryszard Czarnecki of Poland&#39;s ruling PiS party had compared a rival Polish MEP to a Nazi collaborator.
