##### Cyprus-Turkey maritime zones dispute
# The European Union urges calm and restraint after Turkish Navy warships obstruct a Cypriot offshore drilling vessel in the Eastern Mediterranean, which was approaching an area to explore for natural gas. 

The European Union on Monday called on Turkey to avoid threats and &quot;refrain from any actions that might damage good neighborly&quot; ties after Cyprus, a member of the bloc, accused the Turkish military of obstructing a ship exploring for gas.
