# According to his official Facebook page and his spokesperson, Mikheil Saakashvili is abducted by unknown camouflaged people in Kiev, Ukraine. They seized him and drove him away in a white van. The SBU and the General Prosecutor Office deny any involvement. Saakashvili's whereabouts are unknown. The Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs confirms Saakashvili's detention. 

Last year Georgia’s former President Mikheil Saakashvili, who is well known for his extravagant behavior, warned that Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko wanted to kidnap him. Well, it might just have happened…
