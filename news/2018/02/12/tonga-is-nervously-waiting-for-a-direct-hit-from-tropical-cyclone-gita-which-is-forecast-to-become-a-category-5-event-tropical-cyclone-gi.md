# Tonga is nervously waiting for a direct hit from Tropical Cyclone Gita - which is forecast to become a category 5 event. Tropical Cyclone Gita is due to make landfall about 7pm (local time is the same as NZT). It has strengthened overnight and is forecast to strike Tonga. A state of emergency has been declared in the island kingdom and it is thought the cyclone will be the strongest storm ever to hit Tonga in history. 

A state of emergency has been declared as New Zealand aid agencies gear to help.
