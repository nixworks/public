##### War in Afghanistan
# The United Nations report that in 2017, more than 10,000 civilians were killed or wounded in the war. 

The overall civilian toll fell by 9 percent compared to 2016, but the number of deaths from airstrikes saw a significant jump. A resurgent Taliban and &quot;Islamic State&quot; militants inflicted a bulk of the casualties.
