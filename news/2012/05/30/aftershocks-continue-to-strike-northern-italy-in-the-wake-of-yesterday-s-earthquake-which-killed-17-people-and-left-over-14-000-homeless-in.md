##### Aftershocks
# Aftershocks continue to strike northern Italy in the wake of yesterday's earthquake, which killed 17 people and left over 14,000 homeless in the Emilia-Romagna region. 

More than 50 aftershocks struck northern Italy overnight as thousands of people slept in tents or out in the open for fear of returning to their homes, a day after 16 people lost their lives and more than 300 were injured by a powerful earthquake.
