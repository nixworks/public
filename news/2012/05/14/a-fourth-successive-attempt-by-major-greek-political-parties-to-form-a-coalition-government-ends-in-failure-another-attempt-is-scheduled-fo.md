##### Greece
# A fourth successive attempt by major Greek political parties to form a coalition government ends in failure. Another attempt is scheduled for May 15; if a coalition cannot be agreed, emergency elections must be held in June. 

Talks on forming a new Greek government end without a breakthrough but will resume on Tuesday, as European markets fall sharply.
