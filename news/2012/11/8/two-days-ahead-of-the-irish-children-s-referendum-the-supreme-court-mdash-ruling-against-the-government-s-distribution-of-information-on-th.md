##### Irish children's referendum
# Two days ahead of the Irish children's referendum, the Supreme Court&mdash;ruling against the government's distribution of information on the referendum&mdash;finds the government has breached the 1995 McKenna judgement requiring that referendums be explained to the public in an unbiased manner. The referendum's website is immediately taken down.
