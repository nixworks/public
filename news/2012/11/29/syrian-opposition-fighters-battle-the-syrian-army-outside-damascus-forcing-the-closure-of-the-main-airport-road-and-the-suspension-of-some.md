# Syrian opposition fighters battle the Syrian Army outside Damascus, forcing the closure of the main airport road, and the suspension of some flights. 

Syrian rebels battled forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad just outside Damascus on Thursday, cutting access to its international airport, and Dubai-based Emirates airline and EgyptAir stopped flights to the Syrian capital.
