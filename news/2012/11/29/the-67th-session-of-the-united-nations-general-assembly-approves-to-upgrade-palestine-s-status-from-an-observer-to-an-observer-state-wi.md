##### 67th session
# The 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly approves to upgrade Palestine's status from an "observer" to an "observer state", with 138 voting in favor, 9 against and 41 abstaining. 

The UN General Assembly votes to recognise the Palestinians as a non-member observer state, a move strongly opposed by Israel and the US.
