##### The battle
# The battle to succeed Nicolas Sarkozy as leader of the centre-right UMP party takes a farcical turn with both Franois Fillon and rival Jean-Franois Cop claiming the crown. 

A vote to choose the leader of the Union for a Popular Movement party was considered too close to call early Monday, prompting charges of fraud.
