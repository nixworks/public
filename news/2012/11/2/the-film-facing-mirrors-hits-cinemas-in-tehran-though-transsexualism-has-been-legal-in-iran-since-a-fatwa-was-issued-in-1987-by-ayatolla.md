##### Facing Mirrors
# The film "Facing Mirrors" hits cinemas in Tehran. Though transsexualism has been legal in Iran since a fatwa was issued in 1987 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and Iran permits more sex-change operations than any country except Thailand, this is the first time the subject has been treated on the big screen.
