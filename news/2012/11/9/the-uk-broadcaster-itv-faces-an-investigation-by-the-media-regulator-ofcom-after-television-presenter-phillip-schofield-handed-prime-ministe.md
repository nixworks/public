# The UK broadcaster ITV faces an investigation by the media regulator Ofcom after television presenter Phillip Schofield handed Prime Minister David Cameron an internet-generated list of potential suspects in a child abuse case involving a care home during a live interview on Thursday, and asked him to comment. 

The ambushing of the Prime Minister with the names of rumoured Tory paedophiles by the ITV presenter Phillip Schofield has generated more than 100 viewer complaints to Ofcom.
