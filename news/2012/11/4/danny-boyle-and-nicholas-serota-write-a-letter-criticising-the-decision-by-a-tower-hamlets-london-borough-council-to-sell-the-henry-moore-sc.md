# Danny Boyle and Nicholas Serota write a letter criticising the decision by a Tower Hamlets London Borough Council to sell the Henry Moore sculpture "Draped Seated Woman". Moore sold the sculpture at a fraction of its market value in the 1960s on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space in a socially deprived area. 

The Oscar-winning film-maker joins leading arts figures to write a letter protesting the sale of a Henry Moore sculpture by a London council.
