##### DNA
# The first direct photograph of DNA, by Enzo Di Fabrizio, a physics professor at Magna Graecia University in Catanzaro, Italy, is taken. He used an electron microscope (not the usual X-ray crystallography) and a nanoscopic landscape of extremely water-repellant silicon pillars (the water evaporated quickly and left behind the DNA). 

Fifty-nine years after James Watson and Francis Crick deduced the double-helix structure of DNA, a scientist has captured the first direct photograph of the twisted ladder that props up life.
