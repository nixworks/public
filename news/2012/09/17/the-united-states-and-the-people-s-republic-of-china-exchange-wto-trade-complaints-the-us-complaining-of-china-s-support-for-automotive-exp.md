# The United States and the People's Republic of China exchange WTO trade complaints: the US complaining of China's support for automotive exports, and China complaining of new U.S. duties on several of their products. 

President Barack Obama on Monday said the United States was challenging Chinese auto and auto-parts subsidies that threatened American jobs as he campaigned in Ohio, an auto manufacturing state that could be decisive in the November presidential election.
