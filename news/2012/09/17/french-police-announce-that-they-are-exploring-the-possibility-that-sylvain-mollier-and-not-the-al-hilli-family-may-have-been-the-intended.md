# French police announce that they are exploring the possibility that Sylvain Mollier, and not the al-Hilli family, may have been the intended target in the Annecy murders. 

A French cyclist who was shot dead alongside a British family in a massacre in the Alps may have been the &#034;main target&#034; of the massacre, police have suggested.
