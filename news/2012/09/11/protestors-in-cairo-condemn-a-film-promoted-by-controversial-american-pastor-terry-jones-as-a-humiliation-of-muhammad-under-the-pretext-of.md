##### Cairo
# Protestors in Cairo condemn a film promoted by controversial American pastor Terry Jones as a "humiliation of Muhammad under the pretext of freedom of speech". They climb over the walls of the US Embassy and tear down an American flag, replacing it with a black flag inscribed with Islamic emblems. Egyptian police have surrounded the compound to block further incursions. 

Protesters breach the wall at the US embassy in Cairo and tear down a flag over a film they say is insulting to the Prophet Muhammad.
