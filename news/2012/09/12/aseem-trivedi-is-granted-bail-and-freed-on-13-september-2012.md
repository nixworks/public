# Aseem Trivedi is granted bail and freed on 13 September 2012. 

Aseem Trivedi, the Kanpur-based self-publishing cartoonist facing sedition charges, was granted bail on a personal bond of Rs 5,000 by the Bombay high court on a lawyer&rsquo;s PIL on Tuesday. Not wanting to come across as non-cooperative, he finally signed the bond on Wednesday and stepped out of Arthur Road jail.
