# U.S. president Barack Obama strongly condemns the "outrageous attack" that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other U.S. citizens in Benghazi, Libya, saying that the United States rejects denigration of religious beliefs but also rejects the "senseless violence that killed the US diplomat". 

&quot;We are shocked that ... Governor Romney would choose to launch a political attack.&quot;
