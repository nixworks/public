##### Thalidomide
# Now middle-aged victims of Thalidomide ("Softenon", "Contergan")'s mutilating effects on embryos say the first ever apologies from the manufacturer Grunenthal GmbH are "insulting". 

In its first apology for the scandal in 50 years, Grunenthal said on Friday it was “very sorry” for its silence towards victims of the drug, which caused thousands of babies to be born with disabilities
