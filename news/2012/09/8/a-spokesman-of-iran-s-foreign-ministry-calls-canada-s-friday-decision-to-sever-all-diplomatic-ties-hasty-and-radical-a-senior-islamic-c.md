# A spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry calls Canada's Friday decision to sever all diplomatic ties "hasty" and "radical". A senior Islamic Consultative Assembly member describes the decision as "hostile". 

Canada has suspended diplomatic relations with Iran and is expelling Iranian diplomats from Canada, Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird says in a statement.
