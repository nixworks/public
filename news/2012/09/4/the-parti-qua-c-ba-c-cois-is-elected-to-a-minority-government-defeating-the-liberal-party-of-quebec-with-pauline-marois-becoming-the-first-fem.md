##### Parti Quebecois
# The Parti Quebecois is elected to a minority government, defeating the Liberal Party of Quebec, with Pauline Marois becoming the first female premier of Quebec. 

Parti Quebecois Leader Pauline Marois will become Quebec&rsquo;s first female premier after her sovereigntist party won a minority government and ended nearly a decade of Liberal rule in a tense election. But as she delivered her victory speech late Tuesday night, Marois was suddenly whisked off stage due to a shooting outside PQ headquarters.
