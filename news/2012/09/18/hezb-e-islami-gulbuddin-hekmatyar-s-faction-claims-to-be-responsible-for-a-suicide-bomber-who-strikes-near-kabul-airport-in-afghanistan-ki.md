##### Hezb-e-Islami
# Hezb-e-Islami, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's faction, claims to be responsible for a suicide bomber who strikes near Kabul Airport in Afghanistan killing twelve people. 

A suicide attack on a minibus in the Afghan capital killed 12 people on Tuesday, including seven foreigners, and the Hezb-e-Islami insurgent group claimed responsibility, saying the blast was retaliation for a film mocking the Prophet Mohammad.
