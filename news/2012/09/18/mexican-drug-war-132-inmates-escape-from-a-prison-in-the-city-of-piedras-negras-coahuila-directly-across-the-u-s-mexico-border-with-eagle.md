# Mexican Drug War: 132 inmates escape from a prison in the city of Piedras Negras, Coahuila, directly across the U.S-Mexico border with Eagle Pass, Texas, by digging a tunnel underground. The authorities have yet to determine which drug gang was responsible for the jailbreak. 

Officials have found three inmates thought to have escaped through a tunnel at a northern Mexico border prison on Monday. The number of still-escaped prisoners now stands at 129.
