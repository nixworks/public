# Lonmin shares are slightly up on hopes of talks. Solidarity, a major trade union, does not share the optimism yet. A new shooting today at a gold mine in Johannesburg wounds at least four. South Africa conditionally releases 162 of the 270 miners who were detained for killing their fellow miners at Marikana last month. 

Shares of world No. 3 platinum producer Lonmin (LONJ.J) rose 3.5 percent on Monday on prospects for an end to a bloody three-week strike that has paralysed production at its operations in South Africa, where 34 striking miners were shot dead by police last month.
