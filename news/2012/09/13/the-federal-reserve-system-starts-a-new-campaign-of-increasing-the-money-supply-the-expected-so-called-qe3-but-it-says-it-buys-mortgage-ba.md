# The Federal Reserve System starts a new campaign of increasing the money supply, the expected so-called QE3. But it says it buys mortgage-backed securities in an "open-ended" way, essentially "creating" 40 billion US$ each month. The Fed also considers other measures in a bid to stimulate the economy. 

The Federal Reserve opened a new chapter in its efforts to stimulate the American economy, saying that it intends to buy large quantities of mortgage bonds until the job market improves substantially.
