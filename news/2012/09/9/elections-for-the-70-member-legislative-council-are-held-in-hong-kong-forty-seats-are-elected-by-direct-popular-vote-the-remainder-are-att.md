##### Elections
# Elections for the 70-member Legislative Council are held in Hong Kong. Forty seats are elected by direct popular vote, the remainder are attributed by the "functional constituencies": business and special interest groups. China has promised a fully popular vote by the year 2020; the roadmap is still being laid out. 

The Hong Kong government backs down over plans to force schoolchildren to take Chinese patriotism classes, after weeks of protests.
