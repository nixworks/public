##### Annecy murders
# Diplomatic tensions arise over Wednesday's "hit squad" Annecy murders. French investigators may or may not question Saad al-Hilli's colleagues at Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, or SSTL, near Guildford. A British security source suggests as motive "state-sponsored assassination, rather than a family dispute". 

French investigators believe at least two assassins were responsible for murders â€“ and expert says it was probably state-sponsored
