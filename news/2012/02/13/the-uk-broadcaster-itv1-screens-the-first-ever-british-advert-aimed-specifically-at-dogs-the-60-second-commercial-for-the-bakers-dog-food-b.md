##### ITV1
# The UK broadcaster ITV1 screens the first ever British advert aimed specifically at dogs. The 60-second commercial for the Bakers dog food brand features high-pitched sounds that cannot be heard by humans, and is a send up of the 1969 film "The Italian Job". 

If your dog starts barking at the television this evening, don&#039;t be alarmed.
