# Liberal Party of Canada leader Bob Rae states that recent evidence of voter suppressing "robo-calls" played a factor in his party's defeat in the 2011 Canadian federal election. 

Voter suppression tactics, including a pattern of harassing phone calls, were a factor in the Liberal party&amp;#8217;s defeat in the last election, says interim leader Bob Rae.
