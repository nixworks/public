# Treasure from the Spanish Navy frigate "Nuestra Seora de las Mercedes" returns to Spain after being recovered by Odyssey Marine Exploration in 2007. 

Coins worth nearly half a billion dollars finally arrived in Spain on Saturday after lying in a sunken warship for more than 200 years and following a five-year legal battle between the Spanish government and a salvage company.
