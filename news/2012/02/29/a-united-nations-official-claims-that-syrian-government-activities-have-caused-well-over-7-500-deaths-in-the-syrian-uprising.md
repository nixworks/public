# A United Nations official claims that Syrian government activities have caused "well over 7,500 deaths" in the Syrian uprising. 

Heavy fighting raged near Baba Amro in Homs on Wednesday after elite Syrian troops attacked the rebel-held bastion that has endured 25 days of siege and fierce bombardment, activists said.
