# Ray Bradbury, author of "The Martian Chronicles" and "Fahrenheit 451", dies at the age of 91 in his home in the Cheviot Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. 

The imaginative evocations of the future in Mr. Bradbury’s science fiction reflected both the optimism and the anxieties of his own postwar America.
