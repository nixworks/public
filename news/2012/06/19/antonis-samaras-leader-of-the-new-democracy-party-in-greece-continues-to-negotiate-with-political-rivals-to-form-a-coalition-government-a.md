##### Antonis Samaras
# Antonis Samaras, leader of the New Democracy party in Greece, continues to negotiate with political rivals to form a coalition government, as Greece struggles to overcome its economic crisis. 

Greek politicians face the dual challenges of enforcing Greeceâ€™s loan agreement with its foreign creditors while renegotiating enough of the bailout terms to keep the government in power.
