##### Supreme Court of the United States
# The United States Supreme Court rules that Arizona's immigration law is mostly unconstitutional, except for the part that allows for law enforcement officers, in the course of their duties, to ask about an illegal immigrant's legal status if they have actual reasons to believe that the person is an immigrant and is here illegally, especially if they are of relevance to a case. 

US supreme court strikes down some provisions of a controversial immigration law reviled by many Hispanics.
