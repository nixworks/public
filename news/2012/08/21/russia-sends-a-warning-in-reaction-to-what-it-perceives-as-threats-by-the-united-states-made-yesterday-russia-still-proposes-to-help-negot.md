# Russia sends a warning in reaction to what it perceives as threats by the United States, made yesterday. Russia still proposes to help negotiate a deadline to stop violence. 

Russia warned the West on Tuesday against unilateral action on Syria, a day after U.S. President Barack Obama threatened &quot;enormous consequences&quot; if his Syrian counterpart used chemical or biological arms or even moved them in a menacing way.
