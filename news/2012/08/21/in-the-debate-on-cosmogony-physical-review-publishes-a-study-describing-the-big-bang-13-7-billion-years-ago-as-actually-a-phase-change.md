# In the debate on cosmogony, "Physical Review" publishes a study describing the Big Bang, 13.7 billion years ago, as actually a phase change ruled by event symmetry, possibly explaining better how our well-known spacetime could originate from original matter. 

Physicists say the Big Bang was a phase change, like water freezing into ice, rather than an explosion. The theory could have big implications.
