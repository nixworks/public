##### U.S. District Court
# A U.S. District Court judge declines Facebook's $20 million offer to settle a lawsuit revolving around privacy, expressing among other concerns that up to half of that money would be paid to attorneys, and none to the victims. 

Facebook Inc., whose shares fell to a record low yesterday, failed to persuade a judge to approve a $20 million settlement resolving a lawsuit over “sponsored stories” that provides cash for advocacy groups and attorneys and no money for users.
