##### Tal Law
# The Tal Law, which granted a sweeping exemption from military service to a majority of the Israeli ultra-Orthodox population in Israel, expires. As a result Defense Minister Ehud Barak orders the Israeli Defense Forces to prepare for a universal draft of ultra-Orthodox Jewish males in 30 days. 

No haredim slated to be drafted as defense minister orders IDF to create a plan within 30 days on enlistment.
