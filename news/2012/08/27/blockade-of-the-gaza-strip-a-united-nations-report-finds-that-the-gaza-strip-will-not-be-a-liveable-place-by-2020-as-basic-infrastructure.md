##### Blockade of the Gaza Strip
# Blockade of the Gaza Strip: A United Nations report finds that the Gaza Strip will not be "a liveable place" by 2020 as basic infrastructure in water, health, education and sanitation "is struggling to keep pace with a growing population". 

Urgent action is needed to improve basic services in the Gaza Strip or it will not be &quot;liveable&quot; by 2020, according to a new UN report.
