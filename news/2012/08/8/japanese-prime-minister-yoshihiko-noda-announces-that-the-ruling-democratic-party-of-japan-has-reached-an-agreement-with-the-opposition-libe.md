##### Japanese Prime Minister
# Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda announces that the ruling Democratic Party of Japan has reached an agreement with the opposition Liberal Democratic and New Komeito parties to pass a bill that will raise Japan's consumption tax rate. This will "shortly" be followed by dissolution of the Diet and a snap election, although no timetable has been set. 

Japan is set to pass legislation tomorrow to raise the sales tax after the main opposition party failed in a bid to force Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda to set an election date in exchange for support on the bill.
