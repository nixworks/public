# A jury in the U.S. state of California rules that Samsung Electronics owes Apple Inc. over US$1 billion for patent infringement. 

The patent trial of the century is not going well for Samsung; the jury has ruled almost entirely in Apple&amp;#39;s favor, with damages so far totaling a hilarious $1.05 billion. That&amp;#39;s about a quarter of Samsung&amp;#39;s operating profit in Q4 of 2011 (but only a tenth of Apple&amp;#39;s cash on hand), and could have massive repercussions for both it and the industry going forward.
