# London's King Edward VII's Hospital says it is reviewing telephone protocol after two disc jockeys from a Sydney-based radio station, 2Day FM made a prank call to the hospital in which they posed as Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, and spoke with a member of nursing staff about the health of the Duchess of Cambridge. 

The hospital treating the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge says it &quot;deeply regrets&quot; giving information about her to hoax callers from a radio station.
