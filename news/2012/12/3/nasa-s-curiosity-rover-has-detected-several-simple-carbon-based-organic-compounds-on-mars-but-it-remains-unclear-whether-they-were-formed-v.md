# NASA's Curiosity rover has detected several simple carbon-based organic compounds on Mars, but it remains unclear whether they were formed via Earthly contamination or whether they contain only elements indigenous to the planet. 

NASA&#039;s Mars rover Curiosity has found some complex chemistry on Mars, but not proof of organic compounds that could aid primitive life, NASA announced today (Dec. 3).
