# Schools in the United States plan to drop literature classics such as "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "The Catcher in the Rye" from their curriculum; children there will instead learn from "informational texts" such as "Recommended Levels of Insulation" by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the "Invasive Plant Inventory" by California's Invasive Plant Council in order to be better prepared for workplace reading material. 

Schools in America are to drop classic books such as Harper Lee&#039;s To Kill a Mockingbird and JD Salinger&#039;s Catcher in the Rye from their curriculum in favour of &#039;informational texts&#039;.
