# Schools in the United States plan to drop literature classics such as "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "The Catcher in the Rye" from their curriculum; children there will instead learn from "informational texts" such as "Recommended Levels of Insulation" by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the "Invasive Plant Inventory" by California's Invasive Plant Council in order to be better prepared for workplace reading material. 

Schools in America are to drop classic books such as Harper Lee&#039;s To Kill a Mockingbird and JD Salinger&#039;s Catcher in the Rye from their curriculum in favour of &#039;informational texts&#039;.

This follows a totally unrelated outbreak earlier this month connected to Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants. Those restaurants have been cleaned, new ingredients ordered, and have been reopened. The Costco E. coli 157 strain, which has caused five people to be hospitalized- two of which developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS; which can readily lead to acute renal failure and sepsis), is more dangerous than the Chipotle E. coli 026 strain, though there have been no deaths yet. ](/news/2015/11/24/u-s-federal-health-officials-are-investigating-an-outbreak-of-deadly-e-coli-bacteria-that-has-sickened-19-people-in-california-colorado.md) _Context: California, United States_
