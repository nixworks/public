##### Elizabeth II
# Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom attends a Cabinet meeting for the first time to receive a gift in honour of her Diamond Jubilee, including having an area of the British Antarctic Territory named for her. It is believed to be the first time that a British monarch has attended a Cabinet meeting in peace-time since Queen Victoria's reign. 

Part of the British Antarctic Territory is named in honour of the Queen, who also receives 60 place mats at her historic visit to a cabinet meeting.
