##### U.S. Senate
# The U.S. Senate votes to repeal the Jackson-Vanik amendment, a long-standing trade restriction with Russia. In its place, the Magnitsky bill is adopted instead. The law requires the United States to place financial and visa restrictions on a list of officials associated with the torture and death of Sergei Magnitsky three years ago. 

Russia denounces an &quot;absurd&quot; trade bill passed by the US Congress that will also penalise Russian officials linked to human rights violations.
