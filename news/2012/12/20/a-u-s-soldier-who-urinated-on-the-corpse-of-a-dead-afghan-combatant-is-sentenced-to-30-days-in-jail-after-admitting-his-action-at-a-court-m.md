##### U.S.
# A U.S. soldier who urinated on the corpse of a dead Afghan combatant is sentenced to 30 days in jail after admitting his action at a court martial. Reports suggest he will not be sent to jail because of a plea deal reached with military prosecutors. 

A US Marine is reduced in ranks and forfeits $500 pay after admitting urinating on the body of a dead Afghan combatant.
