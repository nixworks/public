# Team members from the British Antarctic Survey temporarily abandon a project to drill through two miles of Antarctica's ice sheet to reach Lake Ellsworth due to problems linking boreholes in the ice. 

A UK project to drill through 3km of ice to reach a lake sequestered for thousands of years has been called off following problems with borehole drilling.
