# Bahraini uprising: Bahrain's highest appeals court postpones for a week the final verdict in the case of imprisoned hunger striker Abdulhadi al-Khawaja and 20 other democracy activists. 

Shells and gunfire from Syrian security forces have killed 33 people in the city of Hama, activists say, as the EU imposes a new round of sanctions.
