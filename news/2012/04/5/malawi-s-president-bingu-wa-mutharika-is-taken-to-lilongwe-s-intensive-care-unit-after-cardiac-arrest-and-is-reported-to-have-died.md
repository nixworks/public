# Malawi's President Bingu wa Mutharika is taken to Lilongwe's intensive care unit after cardiac arrest and is reported to have died. 

Malawi President Bingu wa Mutharika has died after a heart attack, medical and government sources said on Friday, although few of his countrymen mourned a leader widely seen as an autocrat responsible for a stunning economic collapse.
