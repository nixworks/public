# A joint New Year editorial by North Korean media calls for "human shields" to protect new Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. 

North Korea called on its people to rally behind new leader Kim Jong-un and protect him as &#034;human shields&#034; while working to solve the &#034;burning issue&#034; of food shortages by upholding the policies of his late father, Kim Jong-il.
