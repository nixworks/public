# Several major websites, including Reddit and the English Wikipedia, undergo blackouts in protest against controversial internet legislation proposed by the United States Congress. The two pieces of legislation in question are designed to combat online piracy, but are feared to inadvertently threaten online innovation and freedom of speech. 

With a Web-wide protest on Wednesday that includes a shutdown of Wikipedia, the legislative battle over two piracy bills has reached a political coming of age.
