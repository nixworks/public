# ExxonMobil wins US$908 million from an arbitration panel of the International Chamber of Commerce for the nationalization of its Venezuelan oil project in 2007. 

Venezuela says it will pay Exxon Mobil $255m in compensation for nationalised assets - less than a third of what was awarded to the oil giant.
