##### United States House of Representatives
# The Republican-controlled United States House of Representatives votes for the thirty-third time to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare; the measure is not likely to pass the Democratic-controlled United States Senate. 

The repeal will go nowhere in the Senate; sets up talking points for election season
