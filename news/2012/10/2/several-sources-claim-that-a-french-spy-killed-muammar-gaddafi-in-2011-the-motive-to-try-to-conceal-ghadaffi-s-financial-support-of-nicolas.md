# Several sources claim that a French spy killed Muammar Gaddafi in 2011; the motive to try to conceal Ghadaffi's financial support of Nicolas Sarkozy's 2007 presidential election campaign. A French source dismisses the story as "nonsense". 

A&#x20;French&#x20;intelligence&#x20;expert&#x20;has&#x20;poured&#x20;cold&#x20;water&#x20;on&#x20;allegations&#x20;that&#x20;a&#x20;French&#x20;agent&#x20;killed&#x20;Libyan&#x20;leader&#x20;Muammar&#x20;Gaddafi&#x20;after&#x20;making&#x20;a&#x20;deal&#x20;with&#x20;Syria&#x20;to&#x20;save&#x20;then-President&#x20;Nicolas&#x20;Sarkozy&#x20;from&#x20;embarrassing&#x20;campaign-funding&#x20;revelations.
