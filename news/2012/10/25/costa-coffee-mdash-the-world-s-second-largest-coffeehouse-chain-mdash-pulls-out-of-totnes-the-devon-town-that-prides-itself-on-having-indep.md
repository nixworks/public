##### Costa Coffee
# Costa Coffee&mdash;the world's second-largest coffeehouse chain&mdash;pulls out of Totnes, the Devon town that prides itself on having independent shops. 

Costa Coffee, given approval to open in Totnes, pulls out after &quot;recognising the strength of feeling&quot; against it.
