# Syrian civil war: Syrian military airstrikes kill at least 40 people, including civilians, in the rebel-held town of Maaret al-Numan in Idlib governorate. 

Airstrikes sent up dust and rubble and crushed several dozen people who had returned to what they thought was a new haven in a country mired in civil war, witnesses said.
