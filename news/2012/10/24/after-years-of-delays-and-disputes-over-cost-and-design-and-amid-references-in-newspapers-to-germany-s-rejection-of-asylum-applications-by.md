##### Roma
# After years of delays and disputes over cost and design, and amid references in newspapers to Germany's rejection of asylum applications by Roma from Kosovo and comments from the country's interior minister alleging "increasing abuse of asylum from countries in the Balkans", Angela Merkel unveils a memorial near the Reichstag to members of the Roma community killed during the Nazi Holocaust. 

German Chancellor Angela Merkel opens a monument in Berlin commemorating the Roma victims of the Nazi Holocaust.
