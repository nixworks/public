Libya&#x27;s&#x20;newly&#x20;elected&#x20;Prime&#x20;Minister&#x20;Mustafa&#x20;Abushagur&#x20;was&#x20;dismissed&#x20;by&#x20;the&#x20;country&#x27;s&#x20;congress&#x20;on&#x20;Sunday&#x20;after&#x20;members&#x20;passed&#x20;a&#x20;vote&#x20;of&#x20;no&#x20;confidence.&#x20;The&#x20;vote&#x20;came&#x20;after&#x20;lawmakers&#x20;rejected&#x20;Abushagur&#x27;s&#x20;nominations&#x20;for&#x20;a&#x20;new&#x20;government.
