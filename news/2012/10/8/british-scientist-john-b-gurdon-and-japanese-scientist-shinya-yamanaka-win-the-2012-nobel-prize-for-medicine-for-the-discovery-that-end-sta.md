# British scientist John B. Gurdon and Japanese scientist Shinya Yamanaka win the 2012 Nobel Prize for Medicine for the discovery that end stage cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent. 

Scientists from Britain and Japan shared a Nobel Prize on Monday for the discovery that adult cells can be transformed back into embryo-like stem cells that may one day regrow tissue in damaged brains, hearts or other organs.
