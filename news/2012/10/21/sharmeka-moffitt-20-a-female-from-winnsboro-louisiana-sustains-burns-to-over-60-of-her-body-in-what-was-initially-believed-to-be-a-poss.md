##### Sharmeka Moffitt
# Sharmeka Moffitt, 20, a female from Winnsboro, Louisiana, sustains burns to over 60% of her body in what was initially believed to be a possible hate crime after she had claimed, through relatives, to have been set afire by three unknown at large male hoodie-wearing assailants in Winnsboro's Civitan Park. It turned out she is believed by police to have set herself on fire and to have written the slur on her car (she has since opened her eyes and blinked to communicate with relatives at Louisiana State University Hospital Shreveport, where she underwent surgery).
