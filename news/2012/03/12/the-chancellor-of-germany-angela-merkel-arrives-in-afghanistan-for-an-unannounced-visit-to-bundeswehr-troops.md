# The Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel arrives in Afghanistan for an unannounced visit to Bundeswehr troops. 

Afghanistan&#039;s Taliban insurgents today vowed revenge against &quot;sick minded American savages&quot; for the weekend rampage by a US soldier who killed 16 villagers in their homes. The Taliban would &quot;take revenge from the invaders and the savage murderers for every single martyr&quot;, they said in a statement on their website.
