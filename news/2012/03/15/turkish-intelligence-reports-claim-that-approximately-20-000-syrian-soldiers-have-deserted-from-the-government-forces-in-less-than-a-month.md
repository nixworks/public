# Turkish intelligence reports claim that approximately 20,000 Syrian soldiers have deserted from the government forces in less than a month. 

Desertions by members of Syria’s armed forces have swollen to about 60,000 as growing numbers of troops refuse to join the crackdown on protests by President Bashar al-Assad’s government, according to a Turkish Foreign Ministry official.
