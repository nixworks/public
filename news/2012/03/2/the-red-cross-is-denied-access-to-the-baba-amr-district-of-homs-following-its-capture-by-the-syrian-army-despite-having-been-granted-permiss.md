##### Red Cross
# The Red Cross is denied access to the Baba Amr district of Homs following its capture by the Syrian Army despite having been granted permission earlier to provide relief to 4,000 residents. 

The Syrian authorities blocked an officially sanctioned convoy laden with food and medical supplies from entering a devastated neighborhood after a monthlong siege.
