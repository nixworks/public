# The Indian Intelligence Bureau launches an inquiry into whether the office of Defence Minister A. K. Antony had been bugged. 

The Defence Ministry has denied that Defence Minister AK Antony&#039;s office was being bugged, saying an investigation into &quot;inconsistencies&quot; found during a routine sweep has turned up no proof of any bugging device. In a terse press release issued this afternoon, the government said, &quot;Reports of &#039;bugging&#039; in South Block in a section of the media is hereby denied. Routine checks are conducted in the offices of Raksha Mantri and other officers in South Block. Nothing has been found in these checks.&quot;
