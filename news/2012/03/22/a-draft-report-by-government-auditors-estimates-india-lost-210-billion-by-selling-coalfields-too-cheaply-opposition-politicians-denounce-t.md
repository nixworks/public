# A draft report by government auditors estimates India lost $210 billion by selling coalfields too cheaply. Opposition politicians denounce the government for "looting the country". 

The CAG-estimated loss figure of Rs 10.67 lakh crore is 6 times that of its highest presumptive loss figure of Rs 1.76 lakh crore for the 2G scam.
