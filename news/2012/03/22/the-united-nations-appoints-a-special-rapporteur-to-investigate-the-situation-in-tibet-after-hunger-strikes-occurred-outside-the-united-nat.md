# The United Nations appoints a special rapporteur to investigate the situation in Tibet, after hunger strikes occurred outside the United Nations Headquarters building in New York City. 

Three Tibetans who have been quietly starving themselves in the shadow of the United Nations headquarters in New York in an effort to get the UN to pressure China to end its repressive rule over Tibet ended their hunger strike March 22, a month after it began. David Common reports from the scene.
