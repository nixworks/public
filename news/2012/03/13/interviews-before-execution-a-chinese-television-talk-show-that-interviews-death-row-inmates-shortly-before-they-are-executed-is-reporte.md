##### Interviews Before Execution
# "Interviews Before Execution", a Chinese television talk show that interviews death row inmates shortly before they are executed, is reportedly cancelled as a result of a BBC documentary on the programme which has attracted international attention. 

There were question marks yesterday over the future of one of China&#039;s most popular television shows, &quot;Interviews Before Execution&quot;, in which death row prisoners are interviewed shortly before their execution, after its presenter was the subject of a BBC documentary.
