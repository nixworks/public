##### Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
# Physicists from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory report data suggesting the elusive hypothesized Higgs boson ("God particle") may have been detected. 

Physicists say they have found a bump in their data that might be the Higgs boson, a hypothesized particle that is responsible for endowing other elementary particles with mass.
