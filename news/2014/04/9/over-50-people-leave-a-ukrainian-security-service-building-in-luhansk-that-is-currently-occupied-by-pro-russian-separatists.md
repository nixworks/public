##### Luhansk
# Over 50 people leave a Ukrainian security service building in Luhansk that is currently occupied by pro-Russian separatists. 

Pro-Russian separatists reinforced barricades around the state security building in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk on Wednesday and called on President Vladimir Putin for help after the government warned it could use force to restore order.
