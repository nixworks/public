##### Plague of Justinian
# DNA analysis reveals that the Plague of Justinian responsible for killing up to half the population of Europe in 6th century AD was caused by a variant of "Yersinia pestis", the same bacterium believed to have caused the Black Death. 

Modern science has solved a historical cold case by revealing that two of the world&#039;s most devastating plagues, the Black Death and Plague of Justinian - each responsible for killing as many as half the people then in Europe - were caused by distinct versions of the same pathogen, Yersinia pestis.
