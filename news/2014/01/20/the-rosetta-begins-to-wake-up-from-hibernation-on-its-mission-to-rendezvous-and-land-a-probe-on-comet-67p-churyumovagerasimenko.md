##### ''Rosetta'' space probe
# The Rosetta begins to 'wake up' from hibernation on its mission to rendezvous and land a probe on Comet 67P-Churyumov-Gerasimenko. 

European Space Agency controllers wait for a signal from the Rosetta probe that confirms it is awake and ready to resume the audacious mission to chase down a comet.
