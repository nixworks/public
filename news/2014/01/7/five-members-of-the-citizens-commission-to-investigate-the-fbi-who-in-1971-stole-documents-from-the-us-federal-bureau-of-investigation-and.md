##### Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI
# Five members of the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI, who in 1971 stole documents from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and gave them to journalists, come forth. The leak exposed COINTELPRO, a program of surveillance and blackmail against American leftists including Martin Luther King, Jr. 

Burglars who broke into an F.B.I. field office in 1971 and stole files that revealed the extent of the bureauâ€™s surveillance of political groups are only now revealing their identities.
