##### Fisker Automotive
# Fisker Automotive in bankruptcy, asks the judge to reject the official creditors' committee's plan for an auction. The proposed auction would be based on an initial $24.725 million bid from the U.S. unit of Wanxiang Group, a major auto parts concern in China. 

Fisker Automotive, the bankrupt maker of a plug-in hybrid sports car, asked a federal judge to approve its proposed sale to a Hong Kong tycoon rather than a Chinese suitor that Fisker alleged was to blame for its failure.
