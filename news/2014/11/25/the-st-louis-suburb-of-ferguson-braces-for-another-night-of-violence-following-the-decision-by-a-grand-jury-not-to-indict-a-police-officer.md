# The St. Louis suburb of Ferguson braces for another night of violence following the decision by a grand jury not to indict a police officer in relation to the shooting of Michael Brown. 

Missouri&#039;s governor ordered hundreds more state militia into a St. Louis suburb Tuesday after a night of violent protests over a grand jury decision&#039;s not to indict a white police officer in the killing of an unarmed black 18-year-old, a case that has inflamed racial tensions in the U.S.
