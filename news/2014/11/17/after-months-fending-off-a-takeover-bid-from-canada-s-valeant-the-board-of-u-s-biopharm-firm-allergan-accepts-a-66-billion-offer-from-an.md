# After months fending off a takeover bid from Canada's Valeant, the board of U.S. biopharm firm Allergan accepts a $66 billion offer from an Irish white knight, Actavis. 

Botox maker Allergan Inc on Monday accepted a $66 billion takeover bid from Actavis Plc, ending a seven-month hostile pursuit by activist investor William Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.
