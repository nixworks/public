# The President of the United States Barack Obama announces executive orders to defer the deportations of a certain group of illegal immigrants: parents whose children are already U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents who have lived in the United States for five years or more. 

The president sought to convince Americans that his plans to change immigration laws were well within the precedent set by other administrations and did not amount to amnesty.
