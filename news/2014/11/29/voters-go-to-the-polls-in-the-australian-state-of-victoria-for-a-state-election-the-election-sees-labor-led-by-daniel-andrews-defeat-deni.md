# Voters go to the polls in the Australian state of Victoria for a state election. The election sees Labor, led by Daniel Andrews, defeat Denis Napthine's Liberal-National Coalition, the first time a one-term government has lost power in the state since 1955. 

Coalition leader Denis Napthine has conceded defeat and announced that he will be stepping down as leader of the Liberal Party in Victoria.
