##### South Korean Coastguard
# South Korea launches a new National Safety Agency with more than 10,000 staff to replace the Korea Coast Guard, blamed by President Park Geun-hye for a poor response to the sinking of MV "Sewol". 

South Korea launches a massive new government agency this week to handle emergency rescue and safety management seven months after a ferry disaster killed 304 people and was blamed by President Park Geun-hye on a failed response by the coast guard.
