##### Philae
# The Philae landing craft is now "stable" after bouncing hundreds of metres from its initial touchdown, and is sending pictures from the surface of the comet 67P-Churyumov-Gerasimenko. 

After a historic but awkward comet landing, the robot probe Philae is now stable and sending pictures - but faces concerns about its battery life.
