##### High Court
# England's High Court decides that Rusal, the huge Moscow-based aluminum producer, is right in its objections to new rules proposed by London Metal Exchange concerning the use of LME controlled warehouses. 

The London Metal Exchange postponed the implementation of a new warehousing rule after a U.K. judge said its decision was “unfair and unlawful” in a lawsuit brought by United Co. Rusal.
