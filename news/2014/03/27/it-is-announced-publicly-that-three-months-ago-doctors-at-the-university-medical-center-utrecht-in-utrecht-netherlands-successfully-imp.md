##### University Medical Center Utrecht
# It is announced publicly that, three months ago, doctors at the University Medical Center Utrecht, in Utrecht, Netherlands, successfully implanted a 3-D printed skull (most of it), from Australian company Anatomics, in a medical first, into an unnamed female patient. 

Doctors in the Netherlands say a woman is doing fine three months after her deformed skull was replaced with a 3-D printed one.
