##### Hyde Park and Regent's Park bombings
# A court in the UK rules that a man arrested in connection with the 1982 Hyde Park and Regent's Park bombings will not be prosecuted for his involvement.

John Downey will not be prosecuted because he was able to produce documents proving assurances that he would not face trial.
