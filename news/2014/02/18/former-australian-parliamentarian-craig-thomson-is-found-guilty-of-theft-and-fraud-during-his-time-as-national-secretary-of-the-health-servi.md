# Former Australian parliamentarian Craig Thomson is found guilty of theft and fraud during his time as national secretary of the Health Services Union. 

Craig Thomsonâ€™s public fall has been like few others in Australia and it continued on Tuesday when a magistrate found the former federal MP guilty of using union funds for personal use, including paying for sexual services.
