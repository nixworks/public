# The Obama administration orders the transfer of six prisoners from Guantanamo Bay detention camp to Uruguay, the largest single group of detainees to be released in five years and the first to be resettled in South America. 

The transfer announced by the Defense Department was the largest single group of inmates to leave the prison in Cuba since 2009.
