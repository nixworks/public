# The oldest time capsule in the United States is unearthed at the Massachusetts State House. The capsule was first buried in the cornerstone by Samuel Adams in 1795 and reburied by Henry Gardner in 1855. Wrapped in cowhide, four silver coins fell out when it was found. 

The capsule was buried under the Golden Dome of the Massachusetts State House in 1795 by then-Governor Samuel Adams and Paul Revere.
