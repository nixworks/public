# Labor and Hatnuah agree to run in a joint list for the March 2015 elections in Israel in a bid to establish a large center-left political bloc and remove Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from power; Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni, should they win the elections, will share the prime ministership on rotation. 

Labor and Hatnua leaders announce deal to run joint list in upcoming elections; &#8216;only together can we win,&#8217; Herzog says
