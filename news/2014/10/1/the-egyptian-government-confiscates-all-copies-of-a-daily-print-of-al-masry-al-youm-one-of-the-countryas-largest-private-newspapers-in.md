##### Al-Masry Al-Youm
# The Egyptian government confiscates all copies of a daily print of "Al-Masry Al-Youm", one of the country's largest private newspapers, in order to censor an article, days after President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi vowed in a U.S. television interview that there was "no limitation on freedom of expression in Egypt." 

The censorship is another example of restrictions on news media freedom since the military takeover in July 2013 that put Abdel Fattah el-Sisi into power.
