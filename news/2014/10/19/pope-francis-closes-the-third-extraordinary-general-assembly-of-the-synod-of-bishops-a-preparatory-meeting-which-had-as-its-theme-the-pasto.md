##### Pope Francis
# Pope Francis closes the Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, a preparatory meeting which had as its theme the pastoral challenges to the family, with a Mass at the Vatican--with Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and about 70,000 in attendance--featuring the beatification of Pope Paul VI, who concluded and implemented Vatican Council II and gained fame for writing the still-controversial "Humanae Vitae" sexual ethics encyclical.
