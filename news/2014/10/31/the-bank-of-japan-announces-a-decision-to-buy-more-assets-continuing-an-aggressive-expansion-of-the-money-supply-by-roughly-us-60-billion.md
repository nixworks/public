##### Bank of Japan
# The Bank of Japan announces a decision to buy more assets, continuing an aggressive expansion of the money supply, by roughly US$60 billion per month, admitting that it hasn't yet reached its goals on growth. 

The Bank of Japan shocked global financial markets on Friday by expanding its massive stimulus spending in a stark admission that economic growth and inflation have not picked up as much as expected after a sales tax hike in April.
