##### Shanxi
# Two high-ranking officials in China's Shanxi province, Chen Chuanping and Nie Chunyu, are placed under a corruption investigation by Chinese Communist Party authorities. Chen Chuanping was the CPC party chief of Taiyuan, the provincial capital. The president of China Resources Power, Wang Yujun, is also detained. 

China’s anti-graft watchdog said it’s investigating two top officials in the northern province of Shanxi, broadening a campaign in the coal-rich region that’s snared the brother of an aide to former President Hu Jintao.
