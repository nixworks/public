# At least 18 people are executed in public by Hamas after being accused of "collaborating" with Israel. Al Majd, a Hamas website, warns that future suspects will be dealt with "in the field" rather than the courts. 

Witnesses said more than a dozen were killed in what was seen as a message to potential informants after Israelâ€™s assassination of three militant leaders.
