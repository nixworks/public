##### Chelyabinsk meteor
# Research shows that the Chelyabinsk meteor was the remnants of an asteroid that collided with another asteroid 290 million years before entering the Earth's atmosphere over Russia in February of last year. 

An asteroid that exploded over Russia had a force almost 30 times as powerful as an atomic bomb, researchers say.
