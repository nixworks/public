# Voters in Ukraine go to the polls for the first round of voting in the presidential election amidst ongoing violence in the east of the country with exit polls indicating that businessman Petro Poroshenko is headed for victory. 

As Ukrainians vote for a new leader today, the people who live in Novgorodskoe are unlikely to turn out in big numbers.
