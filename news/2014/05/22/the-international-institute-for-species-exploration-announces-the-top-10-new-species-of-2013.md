# The International Institute for Species Exploration announces the "Top 10 New Species" of 2013. 

Each year, an international committee of taxonomists and related experts form a list of the top 10 species of the year. In 2013, the list included such species as the Lesula monkey, lightning roaches and the lyre sponge. Not to be outdone, 2014â€™s list includes a rich mix of biodiversity as well.
