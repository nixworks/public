##### Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health
# Dr. Robert Petzel resigns as the US Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health following a scandal over long waits for care, treatment delays, and falsification of records at VA hospitals. 

The Obama administration, battling to tamp down yet another scandal, announced the resignation Friday afternoon of a top Veterans Affairs official amid mounting questions over patient deaths possibly tied to delayed care.
