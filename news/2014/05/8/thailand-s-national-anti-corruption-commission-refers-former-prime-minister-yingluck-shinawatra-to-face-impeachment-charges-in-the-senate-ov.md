# Thailand's National Anti-Corruption Commission refers former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to face impeachment charges in the Senate over a failed rice subsidy scheme. 

Thailand&#x27;s deposed Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra will face impeachment in the upper house over a costly rice subsidy scheme, the nation&#x27;s anti-graft body said Thursday, in a ruling which could see her banned from politics for five years.
