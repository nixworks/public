# Petro Poroshenko is sworn in as the President of Ukraine as the Pro-Russian separatist conflict continues. 

Petro Poroshenko will be sworn in on Saturday as Ukraine&#039;s president, buoyed by messages of support from the West but still seeking a strategy to deal with Russia&#039;s Vladimir Putin, who opposes Kiev&#039;s military drive against pro-Russian separatists.
