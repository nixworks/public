##### Juan Carlos I
# Prince Felipe, the eldest son of King Juan Carlos I and formerly Prince of Asturias, ascends the Spanish throne as King Felipe VI. 

Felipe&#x27;s coronation on Thursday, following King Juan Carlos&#x27;s recent abdication, will be a low-key secular ceremony tailored to the mood of an austerity-hit Spain

4. [In Sunday's elections, Spain's center-right ruling People's Party (PP) wins 123 seats (35.1%), and the center-left Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) takes 90 (25.7%) of the 350 seats in parliament, thereby ending Spain's two-party system since neither major party won an absolute majority. Turnout was 73 percent. Spain's new political forces, Podemos and Ciudadanos (C's), get 69 and 40 seats, respectively. Smaller parties split the remaining 28 seats, 17 to Catalonia parties which favor secession. It appears that a coalition government will be necessary. PSOE has declined to join the PP, which actually doesn't want that either. King Felipe, who ascended the throne in June 2014, is constitutionally empowered to mediate. ](/news/2015/12/21/in-sunday-s-elections-spain-s-center-right-ruling-people-s-party-pp-wins-123-seats-35-1-and-the-center-left-socialist-workers-party.md) _Context: Felipe VI of Spain_
