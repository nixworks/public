# Romanian President Traian Basescu denies any implication in his brother's graft case in which he is charged with receiving 250,000 euros in order to facilitate the release of a well-known incarcerated mobster. Hours after the president's press conference, his brother, Mircea, was arrested for 24h.

Romanian prosecutors said they detained President Traian Basescu’s brother on Thursday for allegedly taking a bribe to help keep an underworld boss out of jail, prompting the prime minister to call for the president’s resignation.
