# A Russian court in Moscow sentences five men to prison for the 2006 assassination of journalist Anna Politkovskaya. 

The sentences were the toughest punishment to date in the long-running investigation into Anna Politkovskayaâ€™s death, but it is still unclear who paid for and ordered the killing.
