##### New Flemish Alliance
# The New Flemish Alliance decides to opt for membership in the moderately euroskeptic European Conservatives and Reformists group in the European Parliament, meaning this group will surpass the liberal ALDE group as the third-largest. 

A last-minute decision by Flemish separatists to join the ECR group instead of Alde will mean more speaking time and better choice of committee seats for the anti-federalists.
