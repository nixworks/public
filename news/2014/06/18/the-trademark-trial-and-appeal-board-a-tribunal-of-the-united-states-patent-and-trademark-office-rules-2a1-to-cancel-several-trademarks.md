##### Trademark Trial and Appeal Board
# The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, a tribunal of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, rules 2-1 to cancel several trademarks of the NFL's Washington Redskins on the basis that they were "disparaging to Native Americans." The cancellation will be stayed while the team appeals in federal court, a process likely to take years.
