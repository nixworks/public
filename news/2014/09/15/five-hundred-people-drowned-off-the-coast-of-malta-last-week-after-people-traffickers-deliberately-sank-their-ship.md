# Five hundred people drowned off the coast of Malta last week after people traffickers deliberately sank their ship. 

More than 700 people fleeing Africa and the Middle East may have drowned in shipwrecks in the Mediterranean over the last week, bringing the death toll this year to almost 3,000, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said on Monday.
