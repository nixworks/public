##### War in Donbass
# The Ukrainian military say they have repelled a renewed assault by the pro-Russian forces on the Donetsk International Airport. The airport has been under sustained assaults for over 2 weeks despite an official ceasefire. 

Ukrainian forces repelled two fresh assaults by pro-Russia rebels on the airport in the eastern city of Donetsk, a security spokesman said, as fighting for the strategic site showed no sign of ending despite a cease-fire signed nearly a month ago.

Ukrainian authorities say this violates provisions in the Minsk agreement. This is the third such agreement because the previous two in 2014 and 2015 were violated. Low-level fighting and artillery fire never fully stopped. ](/news/2017/02/18/at-the-munich-security-conference-a-truce-between-russian-backed-separatists-and-the-ukrainian-army-per-the-minsk-protocol-takes-effect-m.md) _Context: Ukraine, War in Donbass_
