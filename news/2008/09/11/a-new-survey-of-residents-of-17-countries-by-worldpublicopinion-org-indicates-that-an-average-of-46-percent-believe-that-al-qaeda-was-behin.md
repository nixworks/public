#  A new survey of residents of 17 countries by WorldPublicOpinion.org indicates that an average of 46 percent believe that Al-Qaeda was behind the 9-11 attacks of 2001. 

Seven years after the Sept. 11 attacks, there is no consensus outside the United States that Islamist militants from al Qaeda were responsible, according to an international poll published on Wednesday.
