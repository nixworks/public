#  Preliminary findings made for the American Geophysical Union that support the Clathrate gun hypothesis, indicate the possible release of millions of tons of methane, a greenhouse gas, from Arctic seabeds. 

The first evidence that millions of tons of a greenhouse gas 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide is being released into the atmosphere from beneath the Arctic seabed has been discovered by scientists.
