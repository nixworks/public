[U.S. District Judge William Pauley rules that the country's National Security Agency (NSA) acted lawfully, within the limits of the U.S. Constitution, when, after the September 11, 2001 attacks, it began an en masse bulk collection of metadata from American telephone records.

The allegations were prompted by a memo, obtained by ACLU FOIA requests, dated two months after the Abu Ghraib scandal broke which reference an executive order that authorized questionable interrogation techniques. The White House spokesman flat out denied this in saying "there is no executive order on interrogation techniques". ](/news/2004/12/21/the-white-house-announces-that-allegations-of-abuse-of-prisoners-in-iraq-and-guantanamo-bay-by-us-military-personnel-will-be-fully-investi.md) _Context: ACLU_
