#  The President of the United States George W. Bush authorises tougher sanctions on Myanmar including a freeze on assets held by Myanmar state owned companies held in the United States. 

U.S. President George W. Bush on Thursday said a vote in Myanmar this month would not be &quot;free, fair or credible&quot; and imposed new sanctions on state-owned companies to put pressure on the military junta.
