#  An independent investigation into $8.2 billion in United States Department of Defense spending in Iraq, as well as aid to Egypt and Kuwait since 2001 finds that 95% of payments to contractors failed to meet requirements for documentation to determine what was paid for. 

An audit of $8.2 billion spent on contractors in Iraq found that almost none of the payments followed federal rules.
