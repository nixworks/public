#  In Chilean Patagonia, almost all Chaitn's inhabitants flee the capital city of Palena Province when a nearby volcano erupts after being inactive for 450 years. 

More than 1,500 people had to flee their homes after a huge cloud of ash and lava was thrown into the sky by a long-dormant volcano in southern Chile.
