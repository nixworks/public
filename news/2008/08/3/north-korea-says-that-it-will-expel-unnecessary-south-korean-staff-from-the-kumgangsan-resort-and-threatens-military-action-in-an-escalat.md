#  North Korea says that it will expel "unnecessary" South Korean staff from the Kumgangsan resort and threatens military action in an escalation of tension over the shooting of a South Korean tourist. 

Pyongyang said on Sunday it would expel &quot;unnecessary&quot; South Korean staff from a mountain resort in the North, escalating tension over the killing of a South Korean tourist last month.
