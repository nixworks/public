#  The United States team wins the 4x100 men's freestyle relay setting a new world record with France and Australia finishing second and third respectively. The top five teams all broke the previous world record and Australia's Eamon Sullivan in the lead-off leg broke the record for 100m. 

An incredible anchor leg by Jason Lezak kept Michael Phelpsâ€™ hope of eight gold medals alive.
