##### Latvia
#  Latvia holds a constitutional referendum on whether to allow referendums on dissolving parliament and calling early elections. Although the vote was invalidated, as turnout did not meet the 50% threshold, the results (96% in favour of the change) are considered likely to press politicians to adopt a similar measure nonetheless. 

A Latvian referendum on whether to give people the right to dismiss parliament outside regular elections failed to win enough backing, but an opposition party said a high turnout showed the legislature should go anyway.
