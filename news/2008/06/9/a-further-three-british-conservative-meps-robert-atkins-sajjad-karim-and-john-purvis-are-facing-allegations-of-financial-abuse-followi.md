#  A further three British Conservative MEPs (Robert Atkins, Sajjad Karim, and John Purvis) are facing allegations of financial abuse, following the resignation of two fellow members from European Parliament positions last week. 

More than half of David Cameron&#039;s European MPs have refused to comply with rules requiring them to reveal how they spend their expenses.
