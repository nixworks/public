The most distinctive change in the new currency design is in color. It is the first U.S. currency since 1905 to include colors other than green and black. Different colors for different denominations will make it easier to tell one note from another, and more difficult to counterfeit. ](/news/2003/05/13/the-bureau-of-engraving-and-printing-of-the-treasury-department-of-the-united-states-releases-a-new-20-dollar-note-aimed-at-defeating-the.md) _Context: US$, United States Treasury Department_
