#  North Korea has forbidden ships to sail in an area of the Yellow Sea as it prepares for the launch of 10 short-range missiles. 

North Korea deployed more than 10 missiles on its west coast apparently for an imminent test launch, a South Korean newspaper said on Thursday, and Pyongyang halted U.N. monitoring of its nuclear complex.
