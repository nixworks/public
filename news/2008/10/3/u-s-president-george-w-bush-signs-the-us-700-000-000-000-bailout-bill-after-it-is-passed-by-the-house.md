#  U.S. President George W. Bush signs the US$ 700,000,000,000 bailout bill after it is passed by the House. 

President Bush signed a $700 billion financial bailout package Friday, shortly after the U.S. House passed the rescue measure. The action paved the way for the government to start buying up troubled assets from financial institutions caught on the wrong side of record home foreclosures.
