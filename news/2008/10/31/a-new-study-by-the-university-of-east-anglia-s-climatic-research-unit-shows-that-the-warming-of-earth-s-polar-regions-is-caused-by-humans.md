The general scientific community has already been using 1950 as the year "Before Present", when nuclear weapons began to significantly affect the reliability of radiocarbon dating of objects whose organic matter content formed after that epoch. ](/news/2018/02/19/in-a-scientific-reports-publication-researchers-propose-1965-as-the-start-of-the-anthropocene-era-in-that-year-human-nuclear-weapons-te.md) _Context: Human impact on the environment_
