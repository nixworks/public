The general scientific community has already been using 1950 as the year "Before Physics", when nuclear weapons began to significantly affect the reliability of radiocarbon dating of events that happen after that epoch. ](/news/2018/02/19/in-a-scientific-reports-publication-researchers-propose-1965-as-the-start-of-the-anthropocene-era-in-that-year-human-nuclear-weapons-te.md) _Context: Human impact on the environment_
