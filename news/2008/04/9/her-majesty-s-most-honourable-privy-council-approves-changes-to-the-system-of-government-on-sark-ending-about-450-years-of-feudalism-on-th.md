##### Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council
#  Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council approves changes to the system of government on Sark, ending about 450 years of feudalism on the Channel Island. 

For more than 450 years Sark stood alone as one of Europe&#039;s last bastions of feudal law, but yesterday marked the end of an era for the tiny Channel island as the UK Privy Council approved changes to its system of government, heralding the arrival of democracy for the first time.
