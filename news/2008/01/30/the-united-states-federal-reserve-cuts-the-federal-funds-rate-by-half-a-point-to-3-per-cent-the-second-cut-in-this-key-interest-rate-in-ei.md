#  The United States Federal Reserve cuts the federal funds rate by half a point to 3 per cent, the second cut in this key interest rate in eight days as it acts to head off a recession. 

In lowering its benchmark rate by a half-point to 3 percent, the Fed said that it was worried mainly about an economic slowdown, not rising inflation.
