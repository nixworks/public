#  The Montecito Tea Fire in California burns 2,500 acres and damages more than 100 homes and the campus of Westmont College. 

As a wildfire that devastated the wealthy enclave of Montecito settled down late Friday, a second blaze erupted in Sylmar amid heavy winds and destroyed at least three structures and scorched 100 acres, authorities said.
