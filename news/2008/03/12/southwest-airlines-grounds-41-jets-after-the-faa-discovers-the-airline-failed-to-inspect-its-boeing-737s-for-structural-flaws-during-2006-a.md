#  Southwest Airlines grounds 41 jets after the FAA discovers the airline failed to inspect its Boeing 737s for structural flaws during 2006 and 2007. 

Southwest Airlines Co said on Wednesday it had grounded more than three dozen planes, cutting 4 percent of its scheduled flights, due to another glitch in ensuring safety inspections are completed.
