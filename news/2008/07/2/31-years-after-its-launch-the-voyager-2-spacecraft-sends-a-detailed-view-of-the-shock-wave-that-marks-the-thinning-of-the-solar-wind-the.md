##### Voyager 2
#  31 years after its launch, the Voyager 2 spacecraft sends a detailed view of the shock wave that marks the thinning of the solar wind, the charged particles streaming from the sun, confirming that the heliosphere is actually egg-shaped, possibly due to a tilted magnetic field in local interstellar space. 

Voyagers 1 and 2 discover that key layer of solar system is flattened on one side, probably due to interstellar magnetic field.
