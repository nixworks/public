#  President Bush announces a $17.4 billion emergency bailout of the automobile industry to protect General Motors and Chrysler from bankruptcy during the current automotive crisis. The plan is conditional on the companies' reorganization by March 31, 2009, to show that they can return to viability. 

A $13.4 billion loan to General Motors and Chrysler may be followed by $4 billion more if the Obama administration finds sufficient progress.
