# The China National Space Administration (CNSA) confirms its Tiangong-1 prototype space station, launched in September 2011, is "out of control", and will re-enter and burn up in the atmosphere in late 2017. 

Chinaâ€™s first space station will meet a fiery end next year when the 8.5-tonne module comes crashing down to Earth, amid concerns authorities have lost control of the craft. The Tiangong-1 space station was launched in September 2011 and currently orbits Earth at an altitude of 230 miles (370km).
