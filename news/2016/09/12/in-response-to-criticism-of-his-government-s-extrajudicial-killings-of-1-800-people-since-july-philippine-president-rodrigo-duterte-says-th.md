##### Philippines-United States relations
# In response to criticism of his government's extrajudicial killings of 1,800 people since July, Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte says that U.S. forces advising the Armed Forces of the Philippines against an Islamic insurgency in Mindanao are doing more harm than good and must leave the country, saying, "I do not want a rift with America, but they have to go," during a speech in Manila. 

Social scientists who study extrajudicial killings say the real story is more complicated — and more tragic — than a simple story of good versus evil.
