# In his final speech as President of the United States to the United Nations General Assembly, Barack Obama calls for a renewed commitment to collaborative efforts in facing many of the challenges confronting "an integrated world" community. 

In the last General Assembly address of his presidency, Mr. Obama was focused as much on the American presidential election as on his legacy.
