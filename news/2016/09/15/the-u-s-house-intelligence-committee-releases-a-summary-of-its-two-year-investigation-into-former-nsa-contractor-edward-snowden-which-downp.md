# The U.S. House Intelligence Committee releases a summary of its two-year investigation into former NSA contractor Edward Snowden which downplays his alleged status as a whistleblower while acknowledging "tremendous damage to national security" as a result of the classified documents he stole. 

Bipartisan members of the House Intelligence Committee denounce Edward Snowden as a &quot;criminal&quot; who caused &quot;tremendous damage&quot; to U.S. national security.
