# Hillary Clinton's doctor says she is being treated for pneumonia and dehydration after the Democratic Party presidential candidate fell ill and abruptly left a ceremony in New York City honoring the 15th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. 

The incident, which occurred after months of questions about Mrs. Clintonâ€™s health from Republicans, is likely to increase pressure on her to address the issue.
