# The search continues for survivors of a bridge collapse on the Mumbai-Goa highway over the flooded Savitri River in western India. Twenty two people and two buses are believed to be missing. 

A British-era bridge across the Savitri River on the Mumbai-Goa highway collapsed late on Tuesday night, bringing traffic to a halt on the stretch. Around 20 people are believed to me missing. Two Mumbai-bound buses are among the dozen or so vehicles that are believed to have fallen into the flooded river.
