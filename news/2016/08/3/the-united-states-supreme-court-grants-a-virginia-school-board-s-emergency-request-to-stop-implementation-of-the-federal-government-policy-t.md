##### Supreme Court of the United States
# The United States Supreme Court grants a Virginia school board's emergency request to stop implementation of the federal government policy that calls for student use of the bathroom consistent with their gender identity in order to allow the board to appeal the Fourth Circuit Court ruling that upheld this policy. 

The Supreme Court temporarily blocked a Virginia transgender student from using the boysâ€™ bathroom at his high school, giving local officials time to file a full appeal of a lower court ruling that sided with the high-school junior.
