# Fiji prime minister Voreqe Bainimarama scraps plans to change the flag of Fiji as the feel-good factor envelops the Pacific nation following a first Olympic medal, a gold in men's rugby sevens. 

Prime minister says cost of changing the flag, removing British colonial symbol, was too great and should be directed at cyclone recovery work
