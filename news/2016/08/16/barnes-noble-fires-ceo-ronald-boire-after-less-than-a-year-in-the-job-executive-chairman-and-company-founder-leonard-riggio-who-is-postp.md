# Barnes & Noble fires CEO Ronald Boire after less than a year in the job. Executive Chairman and company founder Leonard Riggio, who is postponing his September retirement, will assume Boire's duties. 

Barnes & Noble Inc said on Tuesday Chief Executive Ronald Boire would leave, after less than a year at the helm, as its board had decided he was not a &quot;good fit&quot; for the bookstore chain operator.
