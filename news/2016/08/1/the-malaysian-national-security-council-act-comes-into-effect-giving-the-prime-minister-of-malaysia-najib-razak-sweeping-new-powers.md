# The Malaysian National Security Council Act comes into effect giving the Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak sweeping new powers. 

A security law has come into force in Malaysia that gives the Prime Minister, Najib Razak, sweeping new powers. As well as letting him declare any area in Malaysia a security zone, the law gives police enhanced powers, including the right to use unlimited force, plus immunity for their acts.
