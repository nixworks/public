##### 2016 Brussels National Institute of Criminology fire
# Multiple individuals rammed a van into the entrance of the Brussels National Institute of Criminology building, setting its laboratories on fire. No casualties have been reported. At least five people are arrested. 

Attackers ram a car through the gates of a Brussels crime laboratory before starting a fire to try and destroy forensic evidence, prosecutors say.
