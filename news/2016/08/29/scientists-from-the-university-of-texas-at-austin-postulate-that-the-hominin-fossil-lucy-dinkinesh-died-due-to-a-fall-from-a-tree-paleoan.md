# Scientists from the University of Texas at Austin postulate that the hominin fossil Lucy (Dinkinesh) died due to a fall from a tree. Paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, who is credited with discovering and naming Lucy, disagrees. 

New analysis suggests that Lucy—one of the most complete hominin fossils ever found—met a tragic end three million years ago.
