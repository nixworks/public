##### Syrian civil war
# Following a ceasefire agreement with the government, Syrian rebels begin evacuating the war-torn suburb of Darayya, near Damascus, ending a four-year-long siege by government forces. Under the terms of surrender, the 8,000 civilians who reside in the suburb will be moved to regime-controlled areas while several hundred rebel fighters will be given passage to the Idlib Governorate. 

For four long years the Damascus suburb of Daraya endured siege, bombardment and starvation at the hands of the Syrian regime.
