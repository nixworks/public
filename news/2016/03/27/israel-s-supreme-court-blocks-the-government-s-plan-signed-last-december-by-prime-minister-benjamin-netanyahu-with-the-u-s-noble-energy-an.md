# Israel's Supreme Court blocks the government's plan, signed last December by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the U.S. Noble Energy and the Israeli Delek Group companies, to develop Israel's offshore gas deposits. The court found the so-called "stability clause," that would prevent Israel from making significant regulatory changes for the next 10 years, undemocratically restricts the Knesset's power. The government has one year to come up with an alternative arrangement or the plan will be canceled. 

The gas deal signed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last December with US and Israeli gas companies to develop Israel&#39;s offshore gas deposits is rejected by High Court on the grounds that the &#39;stability clause&#39; is unconstitutional.
