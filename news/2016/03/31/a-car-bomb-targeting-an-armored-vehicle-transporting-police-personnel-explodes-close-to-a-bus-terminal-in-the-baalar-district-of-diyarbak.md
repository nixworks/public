##### PKK rebellion
# A car bomb, targeting an armored vehicle transporting police personnel, explodes close to a bus terminal in the Baglar district of Diyarbakir, Turkey, killing at least seven police officers and wounding 27 more people, including 13 officers, according to a joint statement by Turkish officials and the police. The attack comes one day before Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's scheduled visit to the city. There has been no claim of responsibility. CNN points out both Kurdish rebels and ISIL militants have claimed similar recent incidents. 

WASHINGTON: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said an attack in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir on Thursday that killed seven people and wounded 27 showed the “ugly face” of militants “as they are cornered.”“This shows terrorism’s ugly face again. The determination of our security forces will put an end” to terrorism, Erdogan said in a speech to the Brookings Institute. He is in the US for a nuclear security summit. A local official in Ankara said all the dead were members of the security forces.
