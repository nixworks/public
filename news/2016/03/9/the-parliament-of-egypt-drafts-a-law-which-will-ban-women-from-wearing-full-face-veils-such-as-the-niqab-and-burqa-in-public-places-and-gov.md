##### Niqab in Egypt
# The Parliament of Egypt drafts a law which will ban women from wearing full-face veils such as the niqab and burqa in public places and government institutions. The move comes after Cairo University recently banned nurses and doctors from wearing veils in medical schools and in teaching hospitals, arguing the ban would "protect patients' rights and interests". 

The Egyptian parliament is drafting a law banning women from wearing the niqab veil. The ban will apply to wearing the clothing in public places and government institutions, it has been reported. The full-face veil is worn by some followers of Islam and typically covers all of the wearerâ€™s face other than their eyes. The clothing is common in Egypt which is a predominantly Muslim country.
