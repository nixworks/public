##### Elections in Germany
# Regional elections take place in the German states of Baden-Wurttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt with the governing Christian Democratic Union performing poorly, the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Germany winning in Rhineland-Palatinate, and the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany performing well in all three states. 

The party of German Chancellor Angela Merkel suffers defeats in two of three states holding regional elections, exit polls suggest.
