##### Pigeons
# Scientists release a small flock of pigeons, dubbed "The Pigeon Air Patrol", carrying tiny backpacks to monitor London's air quality during a period of moderate to high pollution. The backpacks contain sensors used to measure nitrogen dioxide and ozone levels. 

Lightweight pollution sensors record the nitrogen dioxide and ozone in the air.
