##### Terminix
# Terminix, in the U.S. District Court in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, admits it "knowingly" applied fumigants including methyl bromide, which the EPA banned for residential use in 1984, at a resort in St. John that seriously sickened a family of four, and agrees to pay $10 million in fines and restitution. 

A family of four was severely sickened following a Terminix fumigation at a U.S. Virgin Islands resort last year, federal authorities said.
