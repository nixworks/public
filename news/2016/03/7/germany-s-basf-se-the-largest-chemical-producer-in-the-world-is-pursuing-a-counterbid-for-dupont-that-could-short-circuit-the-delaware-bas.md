# Germany's BASF SE, the largest chemical producer in the world, is pursuing a counterbid for DuPont that could short circuit the Delaware-based company's announced merger with fellow American firm, Dow Chemical Company. 

BASF SE is working with advisers and financing banks on the merits of making a counter bid for DuPont Co., the $55 billion chemical company that agreed to a merger with Dow Chemical Co. in December, people with knowledge of the matter said.
