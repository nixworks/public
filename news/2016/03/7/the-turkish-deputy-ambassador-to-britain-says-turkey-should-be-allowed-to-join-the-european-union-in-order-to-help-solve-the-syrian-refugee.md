# The Turkish deputy ambassador to Britain says Turkey should be allowed to join the European Union in order to help solve the Syrian refugee crisis. 

Turkey should be allowed to join the European Union in order to help solve the Syrian refugee crisis happening on its borders, the country has said. Cem Işik, Turkey’s deputy ambassador to Britain, said the country being barred from the EU had contributed to the international migration problems. The country has been an official candidate for EU membership since 1999, with negotiations about accession launched in 2005 – but progress has been very slow.
