# Venezuelan security forces search for 30 gold miners reportedly killed last week in the state of Bolivar in the country's southeast. Survivor reports state the miners were shot last Friday in a fight for control of a gold deposit by criminals who then hid the bodies. Bolivar Governor Francisco Rangel Gomez denies any such massacre occurred. 

Venezuelan authorities said they were investigating the alleged killings of a group of miners in the jungle state of Bolivar, following reports they were gruesomely murdered in a fight for control of a gold deposit. Family members said a gang shot and dismembered 28 miners with a chainsaw on Friday.
