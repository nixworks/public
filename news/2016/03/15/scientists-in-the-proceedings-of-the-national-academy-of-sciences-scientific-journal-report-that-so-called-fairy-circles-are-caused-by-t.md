# Scientists, in the "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences" scientific journal, report that so-called fairy circles are caused by the plants themselves, which have self-organized. Michael Cramer and Nichole Barger suggested this in 2013. 

For decades, scientists have puzzled over bizarre circles in the Namibian landscape. Now, theyâ€™ve found more in Australia.
