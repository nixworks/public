##### Syrian peace process
# The High Negotiations Committee, Syria's main opposition group, will attend Monday's U.N.-brokered peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland, a day shy of the fifth anniversary of the start of the conflict, and two-plus weeks into the ceasefire agreement. Although fighting continues, a significant drop in violence has been seen during the truce. The first round of Geneva talks collapsed on Feb. 3 during a government offensive against rebels in Aleppo. 

The United Nations&#39;s Syria envoy has said delegates are in Geneva for &quot;substantive, deeper&quot; talks between the Syrian government and opposition. Formal talks are set to begin March 14 with an aim to keep ceasefire intact.
