##### U.S. federal court
# A United States federal district judge rules unconstitutional a provision in an Alabama state law that requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. A Florida law enacted today contains a comparable provision to Alabama's. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments a few weeks ago on the constitutionality of similar abortion restrictions in Texas. 

A federal judge on Friday struck down an Alabama law that required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.
