##### FBI-Apple encryption dispute
# A federal judge postpones Tuesday's hearing at the government's request. The FBI says a third party demonstrated a way to access Syed Rizwan Farook's iPhone. Melanie Newman, U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman, says officials are cautiously optimistic a test of this method will allow access to the phone without compromising the data. 

A federal judge has postponed a hearing set for Tuesday that would have been the next step toward settling the battle between Apple and the FBI.
