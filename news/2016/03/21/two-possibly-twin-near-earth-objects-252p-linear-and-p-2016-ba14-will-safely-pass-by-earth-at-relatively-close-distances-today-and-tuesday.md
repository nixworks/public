##### Near-Earth object
# Two possibly-twin near-Earth objects, 252P-LINEAR and P-2016 BA14, will safely pass by Earth at relatively close distances today and Tuesday. 

Two comets will safely fly past Earth next week, giving scientists the chance to determine whether they used to be parts of the same comet.
