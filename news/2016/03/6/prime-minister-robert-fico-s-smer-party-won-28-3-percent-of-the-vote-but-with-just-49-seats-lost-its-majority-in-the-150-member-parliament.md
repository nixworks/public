# Prime Minister Robert Fico's Smer party won 28.3 percent of the vote, but with just 49 seats, lost its majority in the 150-member parliament. The Freedom and Solidarity party won 21 seats (12.1%), and the Ordinary People party took 19 seats (11.0%). 

Slovakia was haunted by its past yesterday after far-right militants who have donned uniforms modelled on a World War II Nazi puppet state won seats for the first time.
