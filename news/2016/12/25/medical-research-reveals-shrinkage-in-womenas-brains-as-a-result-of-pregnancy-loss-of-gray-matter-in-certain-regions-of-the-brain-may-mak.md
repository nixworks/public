# Medical research reveals shrinkage in women's brains as a result of pregnancy. Loss of gray matter in certain regions of the brain may make the brain more efficient and specialized for child-rearing. There is also evidence of links to long-term changes in brain. 

Pregnancy can sculpt a motherâ€™s brain in a way that may help her tune in to her baby.
