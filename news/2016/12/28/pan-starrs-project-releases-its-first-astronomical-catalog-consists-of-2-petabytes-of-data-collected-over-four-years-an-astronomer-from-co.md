##### Pan-STARRS
# Pan-STARRS project releases its first astronomical catalog, consists of 2 petabytes of data collected over four years. An astronomer from collaborating institution also discloses that his group has studied new types of supernova explosions and the disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes from data of this Massive Digital Sky. 

The Pan-STARRS project is publicly releasing the world&#039;s largest digital sky survey from the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). &quot;The Pan-STARRS1 Surveys allow anyone to access millions of images and use the database and catalogs containing precision measurements of billions of stars and g

[Astronomers observe the birth of a symbiotic X-ray binary, a star system in which matter is transferred from a red giant star to a closely orbiting neutron star (the remnant of a star gone supernova), forming an accretion disk and shining brightly in the X-ray. The object, IGR J17329-2731, flared brightly in the X-rays in August 2017. Further study showed it to be a symbiotic X-ray binary, suspected to be flaring for the first time, the neutron star being thus "brought back to life" by the red giant. ](/news/2018/03/7/astronomers-observe-the-birth-of-a-symbiotic-x-ray-binary-a-star-system-in-which-matter-is-transferred-from-a-red-giant-star-to-a-closely-o.md) _Context: supernova_

Such detections are said to be progressively moving this emerging field in astronomy "from novelty to new observational science". ](/news/2017/06/1/scientists-announce-that-the-advanced-laser-interferometer-gravitational-wave-observatory-ligo-has-made-a-third-detection-of-gravitational.md) _Context: black holes_
