##### Yahoo! data breaches
# Yahoo! announces that ID information about more than 1 billion accounts may have been hacked in August 2013. This is separate from the company's earlier disclosure of a data breach of 500,000 accounts in 2014. 

The company says the attack was separate from the breach that led to an earlier disclosure that 500 million accounts were hacked.
