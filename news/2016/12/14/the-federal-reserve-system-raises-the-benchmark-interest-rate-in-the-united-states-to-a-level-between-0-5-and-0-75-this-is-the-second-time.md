##### Federal Reserve System
# The Federal Reserve System raises the benchmark interest rate in the United States to a level between 0.5 and 0.75%. This is the second time in a decade that the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates. 

The increase was only the second since the financial crisis, and the central bank gave little indication that Donald J. Trumpâ€™s election altered its outlook.
