##### U.S. Federal Reserve
# The Federal Reserve System raises the benchmark interest rate in the United States to a level between 0.5 and 0.75%. This is the second time in a decade that the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates. 

The increase was only the second since the financial crisis, and the central bank gave little indication that Donald J. Trump’s election altered its outlook.
