# University of Washington researchers report, in the peer-reviewed "Journal of the American Medical Association Oncology", the discovery of an odontoma -- a "benign tumor" -- in the fossil of a 255-million-year old Tanzanian mammal-like saber-toothed gorgonopsia. This is one of the oldest-known tumors ever found. 

Scientists examining the jawbone of a saber-toothed, mammal-like beast that prowled Tanzania 255 million years ago have come across a remarkable fossil rarity: one of the oldest-known tumors.
