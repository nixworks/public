##### Impeachment process against Park Geun-hye
# South Korean lawmakers impeach President Park Geun-hye by a 234-56 vote. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, a staunch defender of Ms. Park, will serve as acting president. South Korea's Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to render a final decision. 

A slowing economy, a growing nuclear threat from North Korea and a more assertive China are some of the challenges facing the country.
