# A court in Paris finds International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde guilty of negligence in a 404 million euro "misuse of public funds" case. The court ruled that Lagarde won't be fined, won't serve any jail time, or receive a criminal record. The IMF Executive Board "looks forward to continuing to work with" her. 

With the International Monetary Fund facing populist criticism and at a critical juncture, Ms. Lagarde was found guilty of charges linked to her time as Franceâ€™s finance minister.
