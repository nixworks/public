##### Assassination of Andrei Karlov
# The Russian ambassador to Turkey Andrei Karlov is killed in a gun attack at an art gallery in Ankara. Russia calls the assassin, 22-year old police officer, Mevlut Mert Altintas, a "terrorist". Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu goes to Moscow for a planned trilateral meeting on Syria, saying "the incident will not impact relations between Turkey and Russia". 

The shooting at an art exhibit, said to be carried out by a 22-year-old police officer, forced Turkey and Russia to confront a new crisis tied directly to the Syrian conflict.
