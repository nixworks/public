##### Russia-United States relations
# After 35 Russian diplomats are expelled from the United States, Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov recommends expelling 35 American diplomats. Russian President Vladimir Putin rejects Lavrov's recommendation and expresses a desire to restore relations between the two countries. 

In a head-spinning turn, Mr. Putin decided against actions recommended just hours earlier by Sergey V. Lavrov in response to American sanctions and expulsions.
