# Scientists discover that the Totten Glacier is experiencing rapid basal melt, with deep warm water entering underneath the glacier at the rate of 220,000 cubic meters per second. 

Scientists have now put together all the pieces to confirm that the enormous Totten glacier is losing mass rapidly, and the ocean is responsible.
