# Protests, with looting, erupt in several Venezuelan states as citizens lack cash for gas, groceries, and Christmas gifts, since the highly used, but now worthless, 100-bolivar notes were removed from circulation, and the substitute 500-bolivar notes are not available because of delays in bank deliveries.
