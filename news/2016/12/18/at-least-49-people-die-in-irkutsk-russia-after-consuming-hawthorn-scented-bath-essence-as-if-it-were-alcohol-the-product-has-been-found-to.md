##### At least 49 people die
# At least 49 people die in Irkutsk, Russia after consuming hawthorn-scented bath essence as if it were alcohol. The product has been found to contain methanol. 

The tragedy was a reminder that despite President Putinâ€™s star turn on the world stage, Russia remains in many ways a struggling nation.
