##### Iowa Supreme Court
# In the U.S., the Iowa Supreme Court rules juveniles, even those convicted of first-degree murder, can not be sentenced to life without parole, becoming the 19th state to ban such sentences. As of January, about 2,300 American juveniles were serving life-without-parole sentences. 

The character of young people is “a work in progress,” the judges said in setting aside the sentence in a murder case involving a teenager.
