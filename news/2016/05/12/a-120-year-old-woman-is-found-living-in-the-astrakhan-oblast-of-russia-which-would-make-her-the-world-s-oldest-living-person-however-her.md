##### Longevity claims
# A 120-year old woman is found living in the Astrakhan Oblast of Russia, which would make her the world's oldest living person. However, her birth year remains internationally unverified. Thus, 116-year old Italian Emma Morano is still listed as the oldest verified living person. 

 Tanzilya Bisembeyeva was born in the late 19th century, in 1896, and she has four children, ten grandchildren and 13 greatgrandchildren
