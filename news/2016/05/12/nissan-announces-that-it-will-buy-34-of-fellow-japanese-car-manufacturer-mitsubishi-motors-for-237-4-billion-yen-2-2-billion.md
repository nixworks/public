# Nissan announces that it will buy 34% of fellow Japanese car manufacturer Mitsubishi Motors for 237.4 billion yen ($2.2 billion). 

Nissan Motor will purchase a 34 per cent stake in Mitsubishi Motors, as Japan’s second-largest automaker comes to the aid of its minicar partner rocked by a fuel-economy testing scandal. Mitsubishi Motors will sell about 237.4 billion yen ($2.2 billion) in shares to Nissan, according to a statement. The purchase is poised to vault Nissan past Mitsubishi group companies to become the single-largest shareholder of one of Japan’s smallest carmakers.
