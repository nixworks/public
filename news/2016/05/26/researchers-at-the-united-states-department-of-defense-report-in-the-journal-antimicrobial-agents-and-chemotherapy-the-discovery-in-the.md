# Researchers at the United States Department of Defense report, in the journal "Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy", the discovery in the United States of a strain of "E. coli" that includes the new gene MCR-1, which is resistant to colistin, a last-resort antibiotic. 

For the first time, researchers have found a person in the United States carrying bacteria resistant to antibiotics of last resort. CDC chief says this could mean &quot;the end of the road&quot; for antibiotics.
