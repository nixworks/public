# Archaeologists announce the discovery of a 2,400-year-old tomb which they believe to be that of Aristotle based on its grandiosity, and its location atop a hill in Stagira, the city of his birth. 

At a conference for the 2,400th anniversary of Aristotle’s birth, the archaeologist said he had “no proof but strong indications, as certain as one can be.”
