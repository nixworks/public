##### Oklahoma
#  The Oklahoma legislature passes a bill that would make it a felony for doctors to perform abortions and revokes the medical license of assisting physicians. The governor then vetoes the bill. 

The State Senate measure, the first of its kind, would revoke such doctorsâ€™ medical licenses. The bill is on the desk of Gov. Mary Fallin.
