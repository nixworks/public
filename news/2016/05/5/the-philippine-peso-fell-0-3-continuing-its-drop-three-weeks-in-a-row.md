##### Philippine presidential election, 2016
# The Philippine peso fell 0.3% continuing its drop three weeks in a row. 

The Philippine peso keeps on sliding as the May 9 presidential elections get closer. The currency has been falling for three weeks as the mayor of Davao City, Rodrigo Duterte, rises in opinion polls. Duterte ranked third in a Bloomberg survey last month that asked analysts who was the best candidate to run the economy.
