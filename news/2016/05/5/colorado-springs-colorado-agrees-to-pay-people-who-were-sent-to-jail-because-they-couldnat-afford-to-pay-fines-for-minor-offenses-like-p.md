##### Colorado Springs, Colorado
# Colorado Springs, Colorado, agrees to pay people who were sent to jail because they couldn't afford to pay fines for minor offenses like panhandling and jaywalking. The city will pay $125 for each day the person spent behind bars, an estimated total of $103,000 for the 66 people identified. In 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that people cannot be jailed if they do not have the money to pay.
