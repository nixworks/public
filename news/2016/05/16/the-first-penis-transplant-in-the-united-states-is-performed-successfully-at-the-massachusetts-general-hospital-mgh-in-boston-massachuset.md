##### Penis transplant
# The first penis transplant in the United States is performed successfully at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, Massachusetts. Doctors call the operation "a surgical milestone". The patient, 64-year-old Thomas Manning from Halifax, Massachusetts, is the third man worldwide to have had the experimental surgery performed. 

A hospital in Boston becomes the first in the US to perform a successful penis transplant, say doctors, calling the operation &quot;a surgical milestone&quot;.
