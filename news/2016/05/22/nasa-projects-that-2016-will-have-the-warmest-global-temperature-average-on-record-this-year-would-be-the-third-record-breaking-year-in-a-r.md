# NASA projects that 2016 will have the warmest global temperature average on record. This year would be the third record-breaking year in a row. Per NOAA annals, April marked the 12th record warmest month in a row. 

The streak of record warm months continues, thanks to El Ni&ntilde;o and global warming
