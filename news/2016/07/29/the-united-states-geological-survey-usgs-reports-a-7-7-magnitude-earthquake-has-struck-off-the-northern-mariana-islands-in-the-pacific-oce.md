# The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reports a 7.7 magnitude earthquake has struck off the Northern Mariana Islands in the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center says there is no tsunami threat because the quake was very deep in the earth. 

A strong earthquake happened close to Agrihan, in the CNMI, at about 7:18 a.m., according to USGS.
