# Paris, France, implements a pollution-reduction program that bans residents from driving cars built before 1997, and motorcycles built before 2000, on weekdays inside the city limits between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. 

The city is banning pre-1997 cars and pre-2000 motorcycles from the streets in daylight hours during the week — a move opposed by some advocates for the poor and vintage car collectors.
