##### Great Red Spot
# Scientists have discovered that the region directly above the Great Red Spot on the planet Jupiter is about 700deg F (370deg C) warmer than the surrounding upper atmosphere. 

Jupiter&#039;s Great Red Spot may fuel the extreme heat observed in the planet&#039;s upper atmosphere, new research shows.
