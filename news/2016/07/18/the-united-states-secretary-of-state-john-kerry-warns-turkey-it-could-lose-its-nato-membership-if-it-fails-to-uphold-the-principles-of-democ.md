##### Turkey-United States relations
# The United States Secretary of State John Kerry warns Turkey it could lose its NATO membership if it fails to uphold the principles of democracy. Around 8,000 police officers have been sacked in the country following the attempted coup, with more than 6,000 people in the army, the judiciary and other state bodies detained as part of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's crackdown. 

Turkey could fall foul of Nato&#039;s &quot;requirement with respect to democracy&quot; if it fails to uphold the rule of law in the wake of an attempted coup, the US Secretary of State John Kerry has warned. The Turkish government&#039;s response to the failed coup has alarmed both the US and the EU, after it described the plotters as a &quot;cancer&quot; which had to be &quot;cleansed&quot; from public institutions. A State Department spokesman has suggested it is &quot;too soon to say&quot; if a clampdown by the Erdogan government could jeopardise Turkey&#039;s membership of Nato.
