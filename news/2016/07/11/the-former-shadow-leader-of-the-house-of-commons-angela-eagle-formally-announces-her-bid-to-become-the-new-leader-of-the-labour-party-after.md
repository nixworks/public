# The former Shadow Leader of the House of Commons Angela Eagle formally announces her bid to become the new leader of the Labour Party after Jeremy Corbyn refused calls to resign. 

Angela Eagle has pledged to unite her party and the country as she formally announced her challenge to replace Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. Describing herself as a &quot;practical socialist&quot;, she said: &quot;I&amp;#39;m not a Blairite, I&amp;#39;m not a Brownite and I&amp;#39;m not a Corbynista. I am my own woman.&quot; Ms Eagle said the country faced &quot;dark times&quot; after leaving the European Union and said: &quot;Jeremy Corbyn is unable to provide the leadership this huge task needs. I believe I can.&quot;
