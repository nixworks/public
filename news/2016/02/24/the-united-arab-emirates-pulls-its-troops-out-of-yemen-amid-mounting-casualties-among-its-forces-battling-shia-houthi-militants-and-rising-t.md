##### Yemeni Civil War (2015-present)
# The United Arab Emirates pulls its troops out of Yemen amid mounting casualties among its forces battling Shia Houthi militants and rising tensions with local fighters in Aden, southern Yemen, which escalated yesterday when Aden International Airport was stormed by local pro-government gunmen. The airport has now been closed. 

The UAE is a key partner in the Saudi-led coalition which has been bombing Houthi positions in Yemen since March last year
