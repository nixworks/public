##### Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service
# The Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service state that the three people missing since a decommissioned turbine hall partially collapsed at Didcot A power station in Oxfordshire, England, yesterday are unlikely to still be alive. If confirmed, this would raise the death toll to four. 

It is &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that three people missing after the Didcot power station collapse are alive, local fire chief says.
