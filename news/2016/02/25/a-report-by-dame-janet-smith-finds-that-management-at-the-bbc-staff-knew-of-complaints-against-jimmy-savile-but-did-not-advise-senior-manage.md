##### Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal
# A report by Dame Janet Smith finds that management at the BBC staff knew of complaints against Jimmy Savile but did not advise senior management due to a "culture of fear". 

The BBC missed opportunities to stop &quot;monstrous&quot; abuse by DJ Jimmy Savile and broadcaster Stuart Hall because of a &quot;culture of fear&quot;, an inquiry says.
