##### Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War
# Sergey Lavrov, the Foreign Minister of Russia, says that Russia's bombing campaign will continue until terrorist organisations like ISIL and Jabhat al-Nusra are defeated; the Syrian opposition's High Negotiations Committee has voiced outrage at an ongoing government offensive backed by Russian air power and called for a halt to air strikes against civilians, among other demands. 

Russia said Wednesday it would press ahead with its bombing campaign in Syria until &quot;terrorist organisations&quot; such as the Islamic State group are defeated amid the latest international push to end the conflict. &quot;Russian air strikes will not cease until we truly defeat the terrorist organisations

A video emerged of one pilot killed as local rebel Turkmen fighters shot at him while he was parachuting and a video of his body, while the fate of the other pilot is unknown but is presumed dead.
