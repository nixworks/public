##### Comorian presidential election, 2016
# Comoros authorities are counting ballots from Sunday's incident-free, presidential primary on Grande Comore island. The presidency rotates between the nation's three semi-autonomous islands, which also held gubernatorial elections. Provisional results are due Wednesday. Then, on April 10, 2016, the three leading candidates will vie in a runoff. 

Comoros began counting ballots for its first round of presidential elections as authorities hailed an incident-free vote on the Indian Ocean archipelago thatâ€™s been hit by slowing economic growth.
