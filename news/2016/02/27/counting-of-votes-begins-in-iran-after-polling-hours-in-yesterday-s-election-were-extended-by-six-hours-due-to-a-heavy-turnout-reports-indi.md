##### Elections in Iran
# Counting of votes begins in Iran after polling hours in yesterday's election were extended by six hours due to a heavy turnout. Reports indicate that reformist candidates are doing well in the early count. 

Supporters of Rouhani, who championed the nuclear deal, are pitted against hardliners close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameni, who are deeply wary of detente with Western countries. In the capital Tehran, 13 out of the top 16 Assembly of Experts candidates were on a list supported by Rafsanjani
