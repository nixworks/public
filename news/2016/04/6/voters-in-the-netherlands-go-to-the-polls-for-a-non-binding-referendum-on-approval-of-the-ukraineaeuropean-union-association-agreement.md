##### Dutch Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement referendum, 2016
# Voters in the Netherlands go to the polls for a non-binding referendum on approval of the Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement. 

If the organisers of Wednesday&#039;s referendum don&#039;t care about Ukraine, the Dutch government should give them what they ask for and ignore the results.
