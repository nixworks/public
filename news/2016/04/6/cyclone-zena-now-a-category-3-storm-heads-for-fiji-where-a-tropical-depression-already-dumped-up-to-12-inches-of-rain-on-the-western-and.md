##### 2015-16 South Pacific cyclone season
# Cyclone Zena, now a category 3 storm, heads for Fiji, where a tropical depression already dumped up to 12 inches of rain on the western and northern parts of Fiji's largest and most populous island, Viti Levu, triggering major flash flooding that's killed at least two people. The archipelago is still recovering from category 5 Cyclone Winston that killed 44 people in February. 

For the second time this week Fiji, still recovering from late-February Winston, was inundated with more flooding.
