# British department store chain British Home Stores (BHS) collapses into administration after a last-minute rescue deal fails. The collapse of the retailer, which employs 11,000 people, is the biggest failure on the UK's high street since the collapse of Woolworths Group in 2008. 

Administrators Duff &amp; Phelps will keep stores open as they try to find a buyer for the department store chain
