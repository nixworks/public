# Thousands of opposition supporters rally in Harare, Zimbabwe, against President Robert Mugabe and the deteriorating economy. The rally was banned by the police, however, it went ahead after a ruling by the High Court sanctioned the protest. 

Some 2,000 Zimbabwean opposition supporters, some calling on President Mugabe to resign, rally in Harare, the biggest such protest in many years.
