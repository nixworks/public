# The U.S. company Microsoft has sued the United States, alleging that it has been prevented from disclosing warrants to the company's customers in violation of the company's constitutional rights. 

The company is challenging the use of secrecy orders that prevent it from telling people when the government obtains a warrant to read their emails.
