##### United States Treasury Department
# The U.S. Treasury Department announces new regulations to curb tax-avoiding corporate inversions, i.e., where U.S. companies slash their tax bills by claiming a new tax home overseas, though their core operations and management remain in the United States. The pending $160 billion merger of Pfizer Inc. and Allergan, Plc could be cancelled because of these new rules. 

U.S. companies that merge with foreign competitors to reduce their U.S. tax bill now face a third set of new Treasury regulations intended to discourage such activity.
