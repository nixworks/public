##### Supreme Court of the United States
# The United States Supreme Court unanimously rules the one person, one vote requirement may be satisfied by drawing election districts based on the total population of a place, turning down a legal effort to reinterpret the rule that it be based only on the number of people eligible to vote. 

The constitutional maxim does not require states to use eligible voters when drawing legislative districts.
