##### North Korea's nuclear program
# South Korea has determined North Korea is capable of mounting a nuclear warhead on its medium-range Rodong-1 ballistic missile, which could reach all of South Korea and most of Japan, according to a senior government official. 

While South Korea has determined that the North is capable of fitting miniaturized warheads on medium-range missiles, it has no evidence that it has done so, a government official said.
