# A boat carrying Iraqi Kurd migrants sinks off the Greek island of Samos in the Aegean Sea off Turkey's Anatolian coast, killing at least 24 people, including several children, with 11 others missing. 

More than 3,700 migrants died while trying to enter Europe via the Mediterranean last year, and the latest accident was a reminder that the flow has not stopped.
