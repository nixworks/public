##### International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
# The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry confirms the addition of four new chemical elements to the periodic table after scientists from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, United States provided sufficient evidence to fill the elements 113, 115, 117 and 118, which were temporarily named ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium, respectively. 

Discovery of four super-heavy chemical elements by scientists in Russia, America and Japan has been verified by experts and formally added to table
