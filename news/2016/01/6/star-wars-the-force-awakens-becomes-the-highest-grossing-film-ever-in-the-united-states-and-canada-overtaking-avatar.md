##### Star Wars: The Force Awakens
# "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" becomes the highest-grossing film ever in the United States and Canada, overtaking "Avatar". 

J.J. Abrams&#039; record-shattering blockbuster achieved the historic milestone Wednesday after only 20 days in release. Globally, &#039;Force Awakens&#039; is a long way from matching the $2.78 billion earned by &#039;Avatar.&#039;
