##### Italians
# An estimated half-million Italians protest in Rome's Circus Maximus against pending legislation that would legalize same-sex unions. The legislation would extend to civil unions the same rights they would have under marriage, including adoption of children. 

Hundreds of thousands of Italians descended on Rome on Saturday to protest a bill that would legalize same-sex unions across the country.
