# At least 60 people are killed and 110 wounded in a twin-suicide bomb attack in the town of Sayyidah Zaynab, Rif Dimashq Governorate, near Syria's holiest Shi'ite shrine, the Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claim responsibility for the attack. 

The explosions occurred as representatives of Syria&#x27;s government and its divided opposition began convening in Geneva for U.N.-mediated peace talks.
