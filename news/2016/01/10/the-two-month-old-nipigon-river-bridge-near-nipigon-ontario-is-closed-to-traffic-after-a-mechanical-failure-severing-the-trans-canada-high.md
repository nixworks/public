##### Nipigon River Bridge
# The two-month-old Nipigon River Bridge near Nipigon, Ontario is closed to traffic after a mechanical failure, severing the Trans-Canada Highway and forcing a detour into the United States. 

A newly constructed bridge in northern Ontario has heaved apart, indefinitely closing the Trans-Canada highway &mdash; the only road connecting Eastern and Western Canada. At least one town has declared a state of emergency.
