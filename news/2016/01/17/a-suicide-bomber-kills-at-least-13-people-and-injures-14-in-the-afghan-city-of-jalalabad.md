# A suicide bomber kills at least 13 people and injures 14 in the Afghan city of Jalalabad. 

Fourteen people were killed Sunday when a suicide bomber struck a gathering of tribal elders at a prominent politician&#x27;s home in Jalalabad, the second deadly attack in the eastern Afghan city in less than a week. The Taliban denied responsibility for the bombing, which also left 13 people wounded
