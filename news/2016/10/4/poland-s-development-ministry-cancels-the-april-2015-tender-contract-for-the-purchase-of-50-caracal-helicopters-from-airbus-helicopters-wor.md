# Poland's Development Ministry cancels the April 2015 tender contract for the purchase of 50 Caracal helicopters from Airbus Helicopters, worth US$ 3.5 billion. 

The Polish government has cancelled talks with Airbus Helicopters on a multi-billion euro deal to buy military helicopters. The decision reopens the door to the helicopter makers that failed in the original tender.
