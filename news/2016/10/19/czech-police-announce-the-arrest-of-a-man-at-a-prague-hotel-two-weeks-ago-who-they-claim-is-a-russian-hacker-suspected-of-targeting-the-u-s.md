# Czech police announce the arrest of a man at a Prague hotel two weeks ago who they claim is a Russian hacker suspected of targeting the U.S. 

A Russian hacker suspected of targeting the U.S. is being held in Czech Republic. Czech police took the man into custody two weeks ago, but only announced the arrest Wednesday.
