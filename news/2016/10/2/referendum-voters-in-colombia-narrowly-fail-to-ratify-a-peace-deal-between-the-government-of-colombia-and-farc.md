##### Colombian peace agreement referendum, 2016
# Referendum voters in Colombia narrowly fail to ratify a peace deal between the Government of Colombia and FARC. 

Hungarians have overwhelmingly rejected the EU&#39;s refugee quota plan in a referendum. However, less than 50 percent of the country&#39;s 8 million eligible voters have participated in the poll, rendering it invalid.
