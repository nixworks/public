# The Israeli Supreme Court questions the demolition of convicted terrorists' homes by the Israeli government after claims that the practice is used against Palestinians and not Israelis. The government has 30 days to respond before the court makes a decision on the practice. 

The Israeli High Court of Justice has questioned the state policy of terrorism deterrence and gave the government 30 days to justify razing the homes of Palestinian terrorists, when it does not do the same for Jewish extremists.
