# Protesters in Brazil hold a violent demonstration against a proposed public spending cap in the capital Brasilia. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets in order to disperse the demonstrators. 

Thousands of demonstrators on Tuesday evening staged one of the strongest protests against Brazilian President Michel Temer and his fiscal-austerity agenda, turning over cars and trying to break into the countryâ€™s Senate as police fired tear gas and what appeared to be rubber bullets.
