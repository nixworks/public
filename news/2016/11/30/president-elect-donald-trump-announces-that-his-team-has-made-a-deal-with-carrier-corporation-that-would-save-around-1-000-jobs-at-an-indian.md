##### Presidential transition of Donald Trump
# President-elect Donald Trump announces that his team has made a deal with Carrier Corporation that would save around 1,000 jobs at an Indiana factory. Carrier had planned to move production from a key factory in that state to Nuevo Leon, Mexico. 

Reversing a plan the president-elect had assailed, the company will keep roughly half of the 2,000 manufacturing jobs in Indiana that it was to shift to Mexico.
