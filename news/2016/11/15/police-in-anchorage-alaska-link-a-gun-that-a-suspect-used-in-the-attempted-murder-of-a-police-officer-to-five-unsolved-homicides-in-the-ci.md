# Police in Anchorage, Alaska link a gun that a suspect used in the attempted murder of a police officer, to five unsolved homicides in the city which occurred over the summer. The suspect was killed during the murder attempt. 

A gun used to shoot a police officer Saturday morning was the same weapon used in at least five homicides in the city so far this year, including two double homicides, Anchorage police said.
