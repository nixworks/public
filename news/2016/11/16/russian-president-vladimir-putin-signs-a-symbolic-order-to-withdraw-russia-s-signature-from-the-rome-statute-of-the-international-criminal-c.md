##### President of Russia
# Russian President Vladimir Putin signs a symbolic order to withdraw Russia's signature from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) amid calls by pro-rebel western Non-governmental organisations for an investigation into alleged Russian war crimes in Syria. 

Vladimir Putin has signed an order to have Russia withdrawn from the International Criminal Court (ICC) amid calls for his military to be referred over air strikes backing President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and the annexation of Crimea. The President instructed Russia&#039;s foreign ministry to notify the United Nations of the country&#039;s refusal to be subject to the body&#039;s activity on Wednesday, following the same move by Gambia, South Africa and Burundi.
