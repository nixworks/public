# The Editors Guild of India protests the Indian Government's order to shut down Hindi news channel NDTV India for 24 hours alleging the channel's coverage of January's deadly attack on Pathankot air base revealed sensitive military secrets. NDTV denies the charges, and says it will challenge this unprecedented order. 

The government directed NDTV India to go off air for 24 hours starting November 9 midnight for allegedly jeopardizing national security while covering the terror attack on Pathankot airbase in January. This is the first time that a broadcaster has been penalized over coverage of a terror attack.
