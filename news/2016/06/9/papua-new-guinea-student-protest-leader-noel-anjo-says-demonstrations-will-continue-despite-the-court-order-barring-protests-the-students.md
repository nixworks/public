# Papua New Guinea student protest leader Noel Anjo says demonstrations will continue despite the court order barring protests. "The students are not going to give up until and unless the prime minister resigns or surrenders himself to police and is arrested and charged," Anjo said. 

The University of Papua New Guinea obtains an injunction to stop protests, after several people were injured at a demonstration against the prime minister.
