##### Lesedi La Rona
# The Lesedi La Rona diamond, the largest uncut diamond in the world, went on sale at an auction in Mayfair with it expected to sell at GBP52 million, or US$70 million. However, the diamond only managed to draw a high bid of US$61 million, falling short of the reserve price to sell it. 

Vancouver-based Lucara Diamond Corp. has failed to sell the tennis-ball sized diamond it discovered at its Botswana mine last November.
