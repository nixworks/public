# A 15-year-old Palestinian teen is shot and killed by Israel Defense Forces while traveling in his family's car through an area where stones had been thrown that injured two tourists and an Israeli. The IDF says an official investigation has been opened. Preliminary results indicate Mahmoud Rafat Baderan, the teen who was shot, was not involved in any stone throwing on the highway. 

Initial army probe said teen was mistakenly shot at by IDF forces on Route 443; investigation to focus on whether soldiers opened fire according to protocol.
