# Johns Hopkins University researchers report, in the journal "Health Affairs", that media reports about people accused of committing violent crimes having mental illnesses rarely discuss successful treatment of patients, and thereby overstate the problem. Most people exhibiting the types of psychological conditions the media mention are not generally violent. The researchers suggest coverage reinforces fear of mental illness and the people who have it, and, because of the social stigma, discourages people from seeking treatment. 

Despite the media framing people who commit violent crimes as having mental illnesses, people diagnosed with the conditions rarely commit violent acts.
