# China cancels an invitation to a Taiwanese children's choir after it performed the island's national anthem at last month's inauguration of President Tsai Ing-wen; the Puzangalan Choir consisting of children from the Paiwan aboriginal tribe had been due to take part in a choral festival in Guangdong province in July. 

Organizers of an event in Guangdong Province canceled the invitation to the Puzangalan Choir after a performance at the presidential inauguration in Taiwan in May.
