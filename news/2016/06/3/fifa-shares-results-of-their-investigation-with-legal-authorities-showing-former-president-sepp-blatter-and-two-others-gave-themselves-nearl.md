# FIFA shares results of their investigation with legal authorities showing former president Sepp Blatter and two others gave themselves nearly $80 million over the past five years via annual raises and World Cup bonuses. 

Investigators say a series of contract amendments resulted in payouts of tens of millions of dollars in salary and bonuses to the three executives from 2011 to 2015.
