# Airstrikes in rebel-held districts of Aleppo kill at least 15 people and wound dozens while three hospitals are hit including one of the few that still provides pediatric services. UNICEF says medics had to take babies out of incubators. It is unclear who was responsible, though government forces, backed by the Russian Air Force, have run operations to regain control of the divided city. 

At least 15 people are killed in air strikes on rebel-held areas in the Syrian city of Aleppo, seriously damaging medical facilities, the UN says.
