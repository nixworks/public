##### 2016 U.S. election
# The Democratic Party in the Virgin Islands, which has seven unpledged delegates, holds its caucus with Hillary Clinton. The results, along with those from tomorrow's primary in Puerto Rico, could bring Hillary Clinton close to securing the nomination. 

The U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico offer just the number of delegates she needs to reach 2,383 &mdash; but she&rsquo;d need to win every one of them.
