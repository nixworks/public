# Thousands of people are reported to have spontaneously marched in southern China's village of Wukan in Guangdong province over the arrest of the village's democratically elected leader, 70-year-old Lin Zuluan, who had been planning meetings and protests about corruption, illegal land grabs, and the government's failure to return land to the people, per the 2011 agreement. 

Police have locked down a village in southern China to ward off fresh anti-corruption protests nearly five years after an uprising there made it an internationally known symbol of grass-roots defiance against the ruling Communist Party.
