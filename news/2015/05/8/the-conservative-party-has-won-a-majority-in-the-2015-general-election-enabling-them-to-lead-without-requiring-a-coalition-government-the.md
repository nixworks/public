##### Newly elected
# The Conservative Party has won a majority in the 2015 general election, enabling them to lead without requiring a coalition government. The Scottish National Party claims all but three seats in Scotland. 

David Cameron is heading back to Downing Street as prime minister after the Conservatives win a majority - but Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage all resign as leaders of his rival parties.
