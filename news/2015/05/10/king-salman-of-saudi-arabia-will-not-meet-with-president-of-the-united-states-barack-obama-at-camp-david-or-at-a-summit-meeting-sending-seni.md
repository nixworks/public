##### King Salman
# King Salman of Saudi Arabia will not meet with President of the United States Barack Obama at Camp David or at a summit meeting sending senior Ministers instead reportedly due to disagreement over a nuclear deal with Iran. 

The decision appeared to be a signal of Saudi Arabiaâ€™s continued displeasure with the Obama administration over United States relations with Iran, its rising regional adversary.
