##### US Appeals Court
# A US Appeals Court rules that President Barack Obama will not be able to implement his executive action on immigration while it is being challenged by Texas and 25 other states. 

A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that President Obama will not be able to implement his plan to allow millions of illegal immigrants to avoid deportation and obtain work permits in the United States while his executive action is being challenged in court. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 Tuesday that Obama&#039;s November, 2014 directive on immigration must remain on hold while it is appealed by Texas and 25 other states. It&#039;s a big victory for opponents of the program, who have labeled it executive amnesty because it was put in place by Obama over the objections of many, including most Republicans in Congress. The decision means that a lower court ruling blocking millions of illegal immigrants from obtaining work permits and otherwise avoiding deportation will be allowed to stand, delaying the implementation until the court case is resolved. Immigration proponents denounced the ruling.
