##### Estonian parliamentary election, 2015
# The ruling Reform Party wins the elections, but loses the majority that it has had with its current coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party. For the first time in many years, two new parties cross the election threshold, the right-of-centre Free Party and the eurosceptic Conservative People's Party of Estonia. 

The Reform Party, a right of center, market-liberal force that has played a dominant role in Estonian politics for more than a decade, has held off the latest challenge from a social centrist party in this general election and is expected to play a leading role in forming the next government.
