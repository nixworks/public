# SpaceX successfully launches a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of boosting its Dragon spacecraft into space for a Monday arrival at the ISS in the SpaceX CRS-5 resupply mission. However, an experimental recovery attempt of the first stage fails when it crash-lands on a floating platform possibly due to insufficient hydraulic fluid, resulting in damage to the platform. The state of the destruction of the launch vehicle is publically unknown. 

SpaceX&#039;s Falcon 9 rocket blasted the company&#039;s Dragon cargo capsule toward the International Space Station Saturday morning (Jan. 10) â€” and then came back to Earth for a dramatic and highly anticipated landing attempt.
