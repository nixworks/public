# Thousands of police and military personnel prepare to secure a Paris unity rally with up to a million people expected to attend. 

Arson attack on German newspaper that printed Charlie Hebdo cartoons - A building of German newspaper Hamburger Morgenpost was the target of an arson attack and two suspects were arrested, police said on Sunday. Like many other German newspapers, Hamburger Morgenpost had printed cartoons of French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo after the deadly attack on Wednesday in Paris. A police spokeswoman said that an incendiary device was thrown at the newspaper building in the night and documents were burned inside. Two suspects were arrested near the crime scene because they behaved in an unusual manner, she added.
