##### Supreme Court of the United States
# The U.S. Supreme Court agrees to consolidate and hear four appellate rulings whether there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. It is currently allowed in Washington, D.C. and 36 states. Oral arguments will take place in April and a ruling may occur by June. 

The court, after declining to take up the issue in October, is now likely to resolve one of the great civil rights questions of the age before its current term ends in June.
