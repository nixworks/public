# U.S. federal magistrate Carl Barbier's ruling caps BP's fine under the Clean Water Act for its 2010 "Deepwater Horizon" oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico at $13.7 billion. 

BP Plc (BP.L) will face a maximum fine of $13.7 billion under the Clean Water Act for its Gulf of Mexico oil spill, several billion dollars less than feared, after a judge ruled that it was smaller than the U.S. government claimed.
