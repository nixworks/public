# The United States enacts more sanctions on North Korea in response to their alleged involvement in the hacking attack on Sony. The sanctions target the North Korean Special Operation Force and 10 government officials. 

North Korea was hit with more sanctions on Friday designed to impede access to the U.S. financial system in the wake of a cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, which the Obama Administration has said was supported by the reclusive country.
