# NASA's Kepler space observatory announces the discovery of three new planets in the Goldilocks zone capable of supporting life. 

THREE new planets, roughly the size of Earth, have been found in the ‘not too hot, not too cold — just right’ zone around their stars, significantly boosting the numbers of potentially habitable worlds.
