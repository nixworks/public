# Italian police seize 5,361 ancient artifacts worth $64 million from a Swiss-Italian trafficking ring. The discoveries come after various raids on warehouses against Italian art dealer Gianfranco Becchina, who owns an art gallery in Switzerland. 

Italian police seize more than 5,000 ancient artefacts in a record haul after dismantling a Swiss-Italian trafficking ring, the Italian government says.
