# A Palestinian man from the West Bank, Hamza Muhammad Hassan Matrouk, illegally crosses into Israel for the express purpose to stab people attacking over a dozen Israelis on a bus in central Tel Aviv. Security forces capture the assailant as he continued to indiscriminately stab people in the street. 

The assailant, who attacked a bus driver as well as passengers during the morning rush, was shot and wounded by security forces as he tried to escape. At least three victims had serious injuries.
