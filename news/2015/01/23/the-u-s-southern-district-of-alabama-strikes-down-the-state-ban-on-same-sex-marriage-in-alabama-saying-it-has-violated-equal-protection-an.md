##### U.S. Southern District of Alabama
# The U.S. Southern District of Alabama strikes down the state ban on same-sex marriage in Alabama, saying it has violated equal protection and due process rights. Alabama becomes the thirty-seventh state where such marriage is legalized. 

Couples could apply for marriage licenses as early as Saturday after judge says state cannot justify the ban
