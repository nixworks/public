##### Doomsday Clock
# The Doomsday Clock moves two minutes forward, leaving only three minutes from midnight due to the threat of global nuclear war and climate change. It is the closest it has been to midnight since 1984. 

Symbolic clock is now at three minutes to apocalypse, the darkest hour for humanity since the cold war
