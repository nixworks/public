##### University of California, Merced stabbing attack
# The Merced County Sheriff identifies the attacker of four students at the University of California, Merced as freshman Faisal Mohammad. 

Anger over being kicked out of a UC Merced study group drove an 18-year-old computer science student to make a precise plan to kill &ldquo;a lot of people,&rdquo; according to a two-page, hand-written manifesto found during his autopsy, authorities said Thursday.
