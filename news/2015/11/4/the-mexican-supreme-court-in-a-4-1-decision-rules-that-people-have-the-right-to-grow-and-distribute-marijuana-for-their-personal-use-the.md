# The Mexican Supreme Court, in a 4-1 decision, rules that people have the right to grow and distribute marijuana for their personal use. The decision challenges the country's current substance abuse laws. "Fox News Latino" and "The New York Times" point out the ruling only covers the plaintiffs in one case, a group that wants to form a "Pot Club." A precedent will be established if the court approves five similar petitions. 

The Mexican Supreme Court declared Wednesday that people should have the right to grow and distribute marijuana for their personal use, effectively opening the door to legalizing marijuana.
