##### Flight 9268
#  A sudden noise immediately before the "black box" flight data recorder went dark indicates the plane was brought down by a bomb, according to unnamed sources. Officially, Ayman el-Muqadem says the Egyptian investigative team is "considering all possible scenarios for the cause of the accident" and has not yet reached any conclusions. 

The Russian plane crash in Egypt was not due to technical failures, say French aviation officials, adding that the flight data recorder suggests a &quot;violent, sudden&quot; explosion.
