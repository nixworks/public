# Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting. Colorado Springs Police Chief Peter Carey says all nine of the injured - five police officers and four civilians - are listed in good condition at area hospitals. 

The 57-year-old man with a bushy white beard who is suspected of killing three people in a shooting rampage at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado has a history of brushes with the law, including a &quot;peeping Tom&quot; complaint in his home state of South Carolina.
