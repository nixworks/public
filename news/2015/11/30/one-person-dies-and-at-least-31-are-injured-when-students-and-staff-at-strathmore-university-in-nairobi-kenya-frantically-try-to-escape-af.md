# One person dies and at least 31 are injured when students and staff at Strathmore University in Nairobi, Kenya, frantically try to escape after hearing nearby gunshots during an "approved safety and security simulation drill." The Strathmore campus did not hear, before or during the test, that this was a drill. Tensions have been high at Kenyan schools since April when 139 were killed during a terrorist attack at Garissa University College. Many Kenyan universities have held security drills; six were hospitalized at the latest at Kenyatta University. 

A woman has died and at least 31 others have been hospitalised after panic spread during a security exercise at Strathmore University in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.
