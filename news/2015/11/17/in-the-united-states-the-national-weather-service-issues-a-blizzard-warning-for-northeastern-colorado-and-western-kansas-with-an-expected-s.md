# In the United States, the National Weather Service issues a blizzard warning for northeastern Colorado and western Kansas with an expected snowfall by midday of 12 inches in Denver, Colorado. Denver International Airport cancels 143 arriving and departing flighits. Several tornadoes occur overnight in northern Texas, western Kansas, and southern Nebraska. 

More than 100 flights were canceled at Denver International Airport on Tuesday as a powerful storm system dropped snow over the Rocky Mountains, while tornadoes were reported from Texas to Nebraska, officials said.
