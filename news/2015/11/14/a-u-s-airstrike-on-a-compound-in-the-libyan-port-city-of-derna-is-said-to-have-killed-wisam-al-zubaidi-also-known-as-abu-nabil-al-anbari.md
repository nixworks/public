##### Military intervention against ISIL
# A U.S. airstrike on a compound in the Libyan port city of Derna is said to have killed Wisam al Zubaidi, also known as Abu Nabil al-Anbari, who commands the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's branch in Libya. A Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the operation, said the airstrike involved F-15 aircraft and was believed to have killed Zubaidi. He said the attack had been planned for some time. 

A US air strike has probably killed Abu Nabil, the &quot;senior leader&quot; of the Islamic State group in Libya, the Pentagon says.
