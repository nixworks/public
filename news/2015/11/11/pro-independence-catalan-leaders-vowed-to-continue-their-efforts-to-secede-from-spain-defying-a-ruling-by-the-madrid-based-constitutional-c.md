# Pro-independence Catalan leaders vowed to continue their efforts to secede from Spain, defying a ruling by the Madrid-based constitutional court that suspended a law defining a path for independence. 

&quot;We are fulfilling and will continue to fulfill the mandate of a sovereign parliament,&quot; Neus Munte, vice president of the Catalan government, said Wednesday.
