##### 2015 North Indian Ocean cyclone season
# ""Ravaged by months of war, Yemen now gets battered by the first tropical storm on record to make landfall"." Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Chapala slams into Yemen's central coast, with maximum sustained winds of around 140 kph (85 mph) -- the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane. The storm floods coastal areas, brings down electricity lines and destroys houses, with severe threat of mudslides. Chapala is expected to pour over two or three years worth of rain, up to 300 millimeters (12 inches), in a single day. 

The Yemen Post newspaper described the city of Al Mukallah as being &#x201c;under water&#x201d;, saying on Twitter that Chapala &#x201c;drowns city with 40 inches of water&#x201d;.
