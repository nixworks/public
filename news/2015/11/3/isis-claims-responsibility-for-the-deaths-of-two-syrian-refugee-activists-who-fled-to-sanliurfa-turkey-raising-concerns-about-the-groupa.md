##### Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant
# ISIS claims responsibility for the deaths of two Syrian refugee activists who fled to Sanliurfa, Turkey, raising concerns about the group's reach in countries outside of Syria and Iraq. Ibrahim Abdel Qader, a founder of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, and Fares Hammadi are said to have been killed by an acquaintance posing as a defector from ISIS. 

The double killing across the Syrian border from the Islamic State’s stronghold raised unsettling questions about the group’s reach.
