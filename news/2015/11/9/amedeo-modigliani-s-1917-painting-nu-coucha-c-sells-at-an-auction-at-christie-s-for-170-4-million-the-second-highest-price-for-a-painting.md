##### Amedeo Modigliani
# Amedeo Modigliani's 1917 painting "Nu couche" sells at an auction at Christie's for $170.4 million, the second highest price for a painting on record. 

The price tag for the single work was a far cry from the roughly $4,700 in todayâ€™s dollars that Modigliani sought for the entire contents of his Paris studio in 1918-19.
