# The German airline Lufthansa suspends 929 flights leaving 113,000 passengers stranded as a result of a cabin crew strike. 

Germany&#x27;s biggest airline Lufthansa scrapped 929 flights on Monday, grounding 113,000 passengers as cabin crew expanded their strike, and the walkout was set to continue despite a new offer from the company. The action, in its third day, is expected to last a week, becoming the longest in Lufthansa
