##### Military intervention against ISIL
# British Prime Minister David Cameron, in a speech to the House of Commons says that Islamic extremists have already threatened citizens of the United Kingdom and UK military airstrikes against ISIL in Syria will serve only to make the UK safer. Cameron also says that the UK cannot outsource its security and must stand by France in the wake of the November 2015 Paris attacks. 

David Cameron puts the case for air strikes against IS in Syria - with Jeremy Corbyn at odds with half his shadow cabinet on the issue.
