##### Gunfight
# Sixteen (16) people are wounded in a gunfight between two groups that erupted in a New Orleans park's Bunny Friend playground where hundreds of people gathered for a block party and filming of a music video. No fatalities were reported. The fighters ran from the park immediately after the shooting. 

A weekend shootout that wounded 17 people, including a 10-year-old boy, in a New Orleans park appears to be gang-related, city officials said on Monday, as they urged hesitant witnesses to come forward with information about the suspects and a motive.
