# A mailman from Florida was arrested after he made an unauthorized landing of a small gyrocopter with postal service markings on the Capitol West Front Lawn. He had told a newspaper that a terrorist would not have informed the public that he planned a non-violent protest flight for campaign finance reform. 

Florida mailman is believed to be the pilot of the craft, which took off from Gettysburg, Pa., on its way to Washington.
