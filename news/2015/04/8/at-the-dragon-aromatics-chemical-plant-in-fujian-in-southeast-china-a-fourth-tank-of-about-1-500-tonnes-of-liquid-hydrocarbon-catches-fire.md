##### Dragon Aromatics
# At the Dragon Aromatics chemical plant in Fujian in southeast China, a fourth tank of about 1,500 tonnes of liquid hydrocarbon catches fire and explodes. More than 14,000 residents have been evacuated. 

Thousands are evacuated in the southern Chinese province of Fujian as a massive chemical oil fire reignites.
