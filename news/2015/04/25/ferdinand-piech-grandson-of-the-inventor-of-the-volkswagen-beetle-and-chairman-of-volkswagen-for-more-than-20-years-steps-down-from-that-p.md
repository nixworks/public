##### Ferdinand Pich
# Ferdinand Pich, grandson of the inventor of the Volkswagen Beetle and chairman of Volkswagen for more than 20 years, steps down from that post under trade union pressure. 

Ferdinand Piech, a towering figure at Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) for more than two decades, resigned as its chairman on Saturday after losing a showdown he had provoked with Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn, ending an era at the iconic German carmaker.
