##### Indiana Senate Bill 101
# A Christian-owned Indiana pizza shop closes its doors after receiving death and arson threats in response to the restaurant's saying it would not cater a same-sex wedding; the owners are afraid they may close permanently or leave town. 

Supporters of the Indiana family under attack for refusing to cater a hypothetical gay wedding stepped up Thursday, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars and dropping by Memories Pizza even though it remained closed after a rash of threats.
