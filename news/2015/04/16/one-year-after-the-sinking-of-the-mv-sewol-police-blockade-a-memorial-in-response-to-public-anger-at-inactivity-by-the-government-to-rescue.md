##### Sinking of the MV ''Sewol''
# One year after the Sinking of the MV Sewol, police blockade a memorial in response to public anger at inactivity by the government to rescue or salvage the bodies of victims from the ship's wreck. 

The unnecessary use of force by South Korean police against families of the Sewol ferry tragedy is an insult to the victims and a violation of the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, Amnesty International said on Friday.
