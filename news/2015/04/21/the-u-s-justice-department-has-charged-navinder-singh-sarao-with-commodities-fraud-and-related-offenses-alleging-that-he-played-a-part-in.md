##### U.S. Justice Department
# The U.S. Justice Department has charged Navinder Singh Sarao with commodities fraud and related offenses, alleging that he played a part in the flash crash of May 2010. 

A high-frequency trader was arrested in London over his alleged role in the May 2010 &quot;flash crash&quot; that briefly wiped out nearly $1 trillion in market value, the first time authorities have blamed manipulation for the turbulence.
