##### Circumnavigation
#  The circumnavigation attempt of Earth by the solar-powered Solar Impulse plane, currently in Hawaii, has been suspended for the rest of 2015 in order to perform necessary repairs. 

The Swiss team trying to fly a solar-powered plane around the world has abandoned its effort for this year because of the damage sustained by its batteries on the last leg of its global quest.
