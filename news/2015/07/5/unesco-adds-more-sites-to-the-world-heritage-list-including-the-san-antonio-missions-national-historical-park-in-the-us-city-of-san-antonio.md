# UNESCO adds more sites to the World Heritage List including the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park in the US city of San Antonio, Texas and Scotland's Forth Bridge. 

Early Sunday, a delegation from San Antonio was in Bonn, Germany, to witness the World Heritage Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, known as UNESCO, approve the missions’ nomination. “The city of San Antonio is delighted with UNESCO’s action today and the recognition that our Spanish colonial missions are of outstanding cultural historical value to the people of the world,” San Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor said in a news release. City Councilwoman Rebecca Viagran, whose district includes the four missions that make up the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park, called the inscription “a monumental moment for all our families who have lived in and around the missions because we are very proud of being from the South Side.”
