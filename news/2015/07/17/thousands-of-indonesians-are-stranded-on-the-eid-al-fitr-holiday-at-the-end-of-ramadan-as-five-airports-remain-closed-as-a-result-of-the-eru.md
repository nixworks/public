# Thousands of Indonesians are stranded on the Eid al-Fitr holiday at the end of Ramadan as five airports remain closed as a result of the eruption of the Raung and Gamalama volcanoes. 

Ash spewing from two volcanoes in Indonesia prompts the closure of three more airports, which means five are now shut as millions head home for the Eid holiday.
