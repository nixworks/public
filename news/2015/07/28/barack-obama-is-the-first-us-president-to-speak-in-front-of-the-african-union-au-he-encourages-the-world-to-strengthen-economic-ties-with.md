##### Barack Obama
# Barack Obama is the first US president to speak in front of the African Union (AU). He encourages the world to strengthen economic ties with the continent, but also criticises the lack of democracy. 

President Barack Obama became the first American president to address the African Union in the institutionâ€™s 52-year history, a moment lauded for its historical significance but that also underscored how far behind the U.S. is in investing in the continent.
