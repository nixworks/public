##### Greek debt crisis timeline
# Eurozone leaders hold a crisis meeting to discuss options on Greek debt following the referendum as Greek banks are near to running out of cash. For the last week Greek banks allowed to withdraw only 60 euros a day. 

The eurozone gives Greece until Thursday to present final proposals to secure a deal with creditors, and calls a full EU summit for Sunday.
