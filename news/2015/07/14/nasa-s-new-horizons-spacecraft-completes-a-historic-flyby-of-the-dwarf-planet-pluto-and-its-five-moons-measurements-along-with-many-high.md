# NASA's "New Horizons" spacecraft completes a historic flyby of the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. Measurements, along with many high-quality photos and reams of data, were taken, including conclusive information regarding the diameter of Pluto and its moons.

After over nine years of travel in deep space, NASA&#39;s New Horizons spacecraft is within hours of its historic flyby of Pluto. Here&#39;s what to expect as events unfold.
