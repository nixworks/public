# Recent climate change would still cause a 6-meter (20-feet) sea-level rise even if greenhouse gas emissions were reduced today per a scientific paper in "Science".

Without further emission cuts, global temperatures could reach 5˚C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 with devastating effects on oceans and species A global warming increase of less than 2˚C could be enough to raise sea levels by six metres, research has shown. Melting polar ice sheets have...
