##### Patriot Act
# Parts of the Patriot Act expire at 12:01 a.m. due to Congressional failure to reform the USA Freedom Act, temporarily making new surveillance of telephone records by the NSA illegal. 

The governmentâ€™s authority to sweep up bulk phone data in the hunt for terrorists expired temporarily at 12:01 a.m. Monday, but the Senate indicated that legislation to curtail the program is likely to pass this week.
