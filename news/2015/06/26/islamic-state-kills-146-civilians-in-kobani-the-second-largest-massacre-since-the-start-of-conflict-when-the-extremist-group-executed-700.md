##### June 2015 Kobani massacres
#  Islamic State kills 146 civilians in Koban, the second largest massacre since the start of conflict when the extremist group executed 700 members of the al-Sheitaat tribe in eastern Syria. 

ISIS may be trying a diversionary tactic in the city it lost to the Kurds six months ago.
