# The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are investigating a series of fires at black churches in the states of Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia with three of the four cases confirmed as arson. 

Thereâ€™s no indication the fires in states across the South are connected, a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News, but FBI and ATF officials are cooperating with local investigators.
