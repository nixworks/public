##### Charleston church shooting
# Suspected shooter Dylann Roof is arrested at a traffic stop. Roof is suspected of killing nine people including a South Carolinian state senator. He was charged with multiple drug possession in April and reportedly (by CNN) legally bought the gun at a store after passing a background check despite his criminal record. 

Google Inc has become the latest online retailer to pull all products bearing the controversial Confederate flag from sale in the wake of last week&#x27;s racially-motivated massacre at a historic black church in South Carolina. Amazon, eBay, Wal-Mart and Sears have already announced their decision to ban sales of merchandise displaying the image of the flag, which many see as representing racism and slavery.
