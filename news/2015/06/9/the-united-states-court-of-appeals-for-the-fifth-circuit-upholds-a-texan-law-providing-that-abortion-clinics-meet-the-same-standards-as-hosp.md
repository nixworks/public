##### 5th Circuit Court of Appeals
# The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upholds a Texan law providing that abortion clinics meet the same standards as hospital style surgical clinics meaning that many abortion clinics must upgrade or close. 

A federal appellate court upheld some of the toughest provisions of a Texas law, putting more than a dozen abortion clinics at risk of permanently shutting.
