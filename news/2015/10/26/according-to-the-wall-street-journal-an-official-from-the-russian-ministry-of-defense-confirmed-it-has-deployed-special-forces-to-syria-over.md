##### Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War
# According to the Wall Street Journal an official from the Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed it has deployed special forces to Syria over the past weeks supporting its mission to back-up the Bashar al-Assad regime. Alleged Russian Defence Ministry official added that the special forces, who are "akin to the Delta Force of the United States", had been operating in pro-Russian rebel held areas of Ukraine before being called off to Syria. 

Russia has sent a few dozen special-operations troops to Syria from Ukraine in recent weeks, Russian and Western officials say, as the Kremlin shifts focus to supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
