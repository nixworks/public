##### War in Afghanistan (2015-present)
# Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) calls for activating the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission - for the first time since its 1991 creation under the Geneva Conventions - to investigate the deadly U.S. bombing of MSF's hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan. MSF says it does not trust internal military inquiries into the bombing that killed at least 22 people, which it considers a war crime. 

Aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres wants a never-used body to investigate the US bombing of its hospital in the Afghan city of Kunduz.
