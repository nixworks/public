##### Oklahoma Department of Corrections
# The Oklahoma Department of Corrections says a drone carrying mobile phones, drugs, and hacksaw blades crashed at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester before inmates could grab the contraband. This is fourth reported drone-attempt in the United States; the others were at prisons in Ohio, Maryland, and South Carolina. 

The drone - which also carried a mobile phone, cigarettes, cigars, super glue and drugs - clips razor wire before crashing.
