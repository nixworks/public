##### October 2015 nor'easter
# U.S. President Barack Obama declares a state of emergency for South Carolina, after the state receives over two feet of rain in some areas. More than 250 roads across the state close. A low pressure area funnels heavy tropical moisture into the region, as well as, pulls in Hurricane Joaquin-related precipitation. 

&quot;We haven&#x27;t seen this level of rain in the Low Country in 1,000 years,&quot; said Gov. Nikki Haley during a news conference Sunday. &quot;That&#x27;s how big this is.&quot;
