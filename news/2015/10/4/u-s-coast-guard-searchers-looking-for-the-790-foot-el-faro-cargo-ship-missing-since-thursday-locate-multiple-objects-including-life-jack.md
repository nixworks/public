# U.S. Coast Guard searchers, looking for the 790-foot El Faro cargo ship missing since Thursday, locate multiple objects, including life jackets, life rings, containers, and an oil sheen in the waters off The Bahamas. Connection to El Faro is not immediately confirmed. 

Search crews are continuing to look for a U.S. cargo ship caught in Hurricane Joaquin, one day after a life ring from the ship was found.
