##### American Apparel
# Clothing manufacturer and retailer American Apparel files for bankruptcy. The company says that its 200+ retail stores will continue to operate without any interruptions. 

No layoffs were announced in the filing, which still requires approval by the bankruptcy court and is part of a deal that would let the clothing retailer keep most of its 130 U.S. stores open.
