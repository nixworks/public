##### World Bank
# The World Bank estimates that 9.6 percent of the world's population is living in extreme poverty this year, down from 12.8% in 2012. The bank also updated its global poverty line from $1.25 per day to $1.90 per day to reflect inflation and changes in purchasing power around the world; it was last adjusted in 2008. 

It projects 702 million people or 9.6% of the worldâ€™s population will be living in extreme poverty in 2015, down from 902 million people or 12.8% in 2012
