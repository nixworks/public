# The European Union and Turkey reach an agreement for Turkey to stem the flow of migrants into Europe in return for a GBP3bn aid package, easier visa conditions and re-energised talks to join the bloc. 

The European Union has agreed an &quot;action plan&quot; with Turkey to help stem the flow of migrants into Europe. EU leaders offered a Â£3bn aid package, the prospect of easier visas and re-energised talks on joining the bloc if they comply. At a summit in Brussels, it was also agreed that border controls would be coordinated to slow the influx of migrants crossing from Turkey to Asia. Chairman Donald Tusk said: &quot;Our intensified meetings with Turkish leaders in the last couple of weeks were devoted to one goal: stemming the migratory flows that go via Turkey to the EU. &quot;The action plan is a major step in this direction.&quot;
