# A U.S. federal judge declines plaintiffs request for an emergency order requiring Texas issue birth certificates to U.S.-born children of immigrant families who entered the country illegally. The judge said Matricula Consular cards issued by Mexican consulates to their citizens in the U.S. aren't secure. The U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantees the right of citizenship to children born in the United States. 

A federal judge has chosen for now not to force Texas health officials to change their stance in denying birth certificates to immigrant families with U.S- born children, saying that the families raised &ldquo;grave concerns&rdquo; but more evidence is needed, according to a ruling issued Friday.
