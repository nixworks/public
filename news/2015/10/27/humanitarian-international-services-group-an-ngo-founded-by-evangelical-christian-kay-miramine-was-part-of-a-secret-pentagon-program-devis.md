##### Humanitarian International Services Group
# Humanitarian International Services Group, an NGO founded by evangelical Christian Kay Miramine, was part of a secret Pentagon program devised by Lt. Gen. William Boykin used to spy on North Korea, according to an investigation by the online publication "The Intercept." The program, which started in 2004, was shut down in 2012 by now-retired Admiral William McRaven, concerned with pushback if this became public. Some current and former American NGO staff with experience in North Korea have expressed doubts about key claims in the report. 

Leaving his own employees in the dark, the leader of an award-winning Christian NGO helped the Pentagon conduct espionage in North Korea while hiding the source of the organization&#39;s funding, according to sources interviewed for this special investigation.
