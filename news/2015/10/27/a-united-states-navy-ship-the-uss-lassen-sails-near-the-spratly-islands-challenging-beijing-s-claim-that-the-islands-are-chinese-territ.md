##### Tensions in the region
# A United States Navy ship, the USS "Lassen", sails near the Spratly Islands, challenging Beijing's claim that the islands are Chinese territory. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned the actions of the United States in the South China Sea, saying "China will firmly react to this deliberate provocation". 

A U.S. Navy destroyer sailed within 12 nautical miles of artificial islands claimed by China in a direct challenge to Beijing that raises the stakes in an expanding, multination territorial dispute.
