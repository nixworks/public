# The United Parcel Service pilots' union authorizes its executive board to call a strike at the board's discretion as contract talks slog into a fifth year. This is in the wake of competitor FedEx pilots' approval of a new six-year contract. 

The union representing United Parcel Service pilots voted overwhelmingly to strike as contract negotiations enter their fifth year, a very public signal of employee dissatisfaction at the delivery giant as its all-important holiday peak fast approaches.
