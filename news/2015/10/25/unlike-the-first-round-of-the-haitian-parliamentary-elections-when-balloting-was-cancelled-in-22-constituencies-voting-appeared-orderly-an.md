##### Haitian presidential election, 2015
# Unlike the first round of the Haitian parliamentary elections when balloting was cancelled in 22 constituencies, voting appeared orderly, and largely peaceful, with a large turnout in Sunday's presidential and parliamentary second round elections. Electoral officials said there might be partial results in 10 days but final results would not be ready until late November. Haitians faced lengthy ballots featuring 54 presidential hopefuls and significant numbers of legislative and municipal candidates. An expected runoff between the top two presidential candidates is scheduled for December 27. 

Haiti&rsquo;s elections officials Sunday thanked voters for a relatively calm election day and appealed for patience as they try to figure out who the winners are in the balloting for presidential, legislative and local mayoral elections.
