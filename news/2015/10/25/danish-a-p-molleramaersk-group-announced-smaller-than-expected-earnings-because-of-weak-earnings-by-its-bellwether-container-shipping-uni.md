# Danish A.P. Moller-Maersk Group announced smaller-than-expected earnings because of weak earnings by its bellwether container shipping unit, Maersk Line. 

Danish conglomerate A.P. Møller-Maersk cut its full-year profit guidance, saying global demand for container shipping—the conglomerate’s biggest contributor—has been weaker than expected.
