##### Nayantara Sahgal
# Nayantara Sahgal, is one of the latest authors in India who will return that nation's highest award from the National Academy of Letters in protest against what Salman Rushdie has characterized as "thuggish violence" creeping into Indian life under the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 

The revolt now confronts Prime Minister Narendra Modi with a critical test of his vaunted ability to shape the public narrative of his administration.
