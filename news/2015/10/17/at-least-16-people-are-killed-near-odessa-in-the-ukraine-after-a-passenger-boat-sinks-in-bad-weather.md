# At least 16 people are killed near Odessa in the Ukraine after a passenger boat sinks in bad weather. 

At least 14 people have been killed after a ship taking passengers back from a fishing trip sank near Odessa, on the Black Sea coast. Authorities blame the owners of the vessel for going out despite weather warnings, and failing to provide life jackets for those on board.
