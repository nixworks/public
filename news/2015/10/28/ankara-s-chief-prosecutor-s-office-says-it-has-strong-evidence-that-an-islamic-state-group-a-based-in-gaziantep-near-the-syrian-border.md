##### 2015 Ankara bombings
# Ankara's Chief Prosecutor's office says it has "strong evidence" that an Islamic State group -- based in Gaziantep, near the Syrian border -- is behind the bombings at this month's Ankara peace rally that killed 102 people, as well as four previous attacks in Turkey since May that have mainly targeted supporters of a pro-Kurdish party. 

A massive twin bombing in the Turkish capital Ankara this month that killed 102 people was ordered by the terrorist Islamic State group, prosecutors said today.
