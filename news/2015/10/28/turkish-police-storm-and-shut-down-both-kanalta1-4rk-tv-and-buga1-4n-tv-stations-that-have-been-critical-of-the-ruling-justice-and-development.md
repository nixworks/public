# Turkish police storm and shut down both Kanalturk TV and Bugun, TV stations that have been critical of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) ahead of a general election on November 1. Baris Yarkadas, a lawmaker with the main-opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), said "We are witnessing the police entering news organizations, delivering declarations and taking over journalists' seats--just like junta periods, this is called a police state". 

Turkish authorities on Wednesday seized control of two television stations that have been critical of the government before an election Sunday, as officials expanded a probe of what they allege is a coup plot against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
