# Quebec-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals International cut all ties with Philidor Rx Services. This comes in the wake of recent revelations that Valeant was looking to acquire Philidor, a relationship that raised questions from various quarters. Valeant is the subject of U.S. federal investigations. 

The drug maker had been criticized for recommending Philidor Rx Services because it discouraged the prescription of less-expensive medicines.
