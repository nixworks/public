# Mathematicians at the University of Washington Bothell discover a new type of pentagon tiling, the first new type of "tiling the plane" with a single polygon since 1985. 

For decades, we have known of only 14 convex pentagons that can do something called &quot;tiling the plane.&quot; Now there is a 15th shape, but mathematicians are still far from knowing exactly how many exist.
