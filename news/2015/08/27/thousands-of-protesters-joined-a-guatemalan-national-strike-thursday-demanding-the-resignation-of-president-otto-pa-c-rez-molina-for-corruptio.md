# Thousands of protesters joined a Guatemalan national strike Thursday demanding the resignation of President Otto Perez Molina for corruption. Five of 13 cabinet ministers have resigned since Friday, and Tuesday, the Supreme Court unanimously approved a motion to impeach the president. 

An estimated 70,000 protesters filled a central plaza in Guatemala City on Thursday as part of a national strike that saw some businesses close and marchers block highways demanding President Otto Perez Molina resign for alleged bribery.
