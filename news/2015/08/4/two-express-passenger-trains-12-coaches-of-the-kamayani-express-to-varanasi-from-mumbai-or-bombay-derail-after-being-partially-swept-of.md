##### Kamayani Express
# Two express passenger trains (12 coaches of the Kamayani Express; to Varanasi from Mumbai, or Bombay) derail, after being partially swept off a bridge while crossing flooded tracks in India's Madhya Pradesh state leaving at least 31 people killed and about 100 others injured. Related to this incident are monsoon rains and the end of a cyclone which have killed more than 100 people in India. 

At least 28 people have died and 40 are injured after two passenger trains derailed within minutes of each other while crossing flooded tracks in Madhya Pradesh late on Tuesday night. More than 25 are missing, say sources.
