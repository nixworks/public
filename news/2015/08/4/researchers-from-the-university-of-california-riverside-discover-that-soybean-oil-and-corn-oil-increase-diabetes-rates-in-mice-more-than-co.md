[The journal "Genes & Development" publishes research from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in a mouse-model study (which may translate over to humans) alluding as to why hair turns gray and goes bald. The scientists describe a protein called KROX20 which switches on skin cells that become a hair shaft, which then causes cells to produce another protein called stem cell factor. In mice, these two proteins are important for baldness and graying. ](/news/2017/05/8/the-journal-genes-development-publishes-research-from-the-university-of-texas-southwestern-medical-center-in-a-mouse-model-study-which.md) _Context: mouse_
