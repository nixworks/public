##### Iraqi Prime Minister
# The Prime Minister of Iraq Haider al-Abadi calls for abolishing the positions of Vice President and Deputy Prime Minister and says he is opening graft investigations. The previous vice president Tariq al-Hashimi was sentenced in absentia to death over political murders. 

Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar Al-Abadi, backed by the nationâ€™s top Shiite cleric, vowed to investigate corruption and proposed abolishing key government posts in a move that will test his authority in the fractured country.
