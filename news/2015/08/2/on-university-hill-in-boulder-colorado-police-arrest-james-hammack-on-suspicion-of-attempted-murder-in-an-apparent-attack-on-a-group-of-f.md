# On University Hill in Boulder, Colorado, police arrest James Hammack on suspicion of attempted murder. In an apparent attack on a group of four college-age men, witnesses say he yelled ""You trying to die tonight?," before rushing into the group and stabbed one man.

Boulder police have arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of attempted murder after witnesses said he came up from behind and stabbed another man twice in the forearm on University Hill over the weekend.
