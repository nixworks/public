##### Canadian Prime Minister
# Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper confirms that he has asked Governor General David Johnston to dissolve the Canadian Parliament and set a general election for October 19. This will be the longest election campaign for Canada in recent history, since voting was once staggered over months to accommodate people travelling from remote regions of the country using archaic means of transportation. 

Conservative Leader Stephen Harper has kicked off what will be the longest federal election campaign in recent history.
