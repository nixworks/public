##### Egypt
# In an education scandal in Egypt, a top student, Mariam Malak, says she's a victim of corruption and fraud with the school or the examination board purposefully swapping her final exam papers with another pupil, while she is thus assigned "Zero"-grade for each of the seven subjects. 40,000 online rally for her via a Facebook support page while another top student reporting the same complaint. 

Thousands rallied behind a top-ranked student who not only failed her exams but was given the lowest marks possible in a potential case of injustice and corruption.
