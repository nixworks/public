##### CNIL
# French regulator Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertes (CNIL) rejects Google, Inc.'s appeal of their order that the company remove 'Right to be forgotten (RTBF)' search results worldwide. Failure to comply could subject Google to sanctions, from EUR300,000 (US$460,000) to 5 percent of global operating costs. 

Search engineâ€™s attempt to block French order to apply delistings to its google.com domain, not just its European sites, dismissed in ground-breaking case
