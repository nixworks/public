##### Volkswagen emissions violations
# Volkswagen says that 11 million vehicles could have suspect emission control software and it has set aside 6.5 billion euros ($7.2 billion US dollars) for possible fines, repairs, and litigation. 

It&#x27;s a figure that could be eclipsed by potential penalties and lawsuits facing the German automaker in the U.S.
