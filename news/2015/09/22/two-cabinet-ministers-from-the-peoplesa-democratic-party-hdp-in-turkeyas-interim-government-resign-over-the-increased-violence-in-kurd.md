# Two Cabinet ministers from the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) in Turkey's interim government resign over the increased violence in Kurdish areas of the country. Their exit leaves no opposition figures in the government. 

Turkey moved swiftly on Tuesday to replace two ministers from a pro-Kurdish party who quit its interim government amid rising tensions after a ceasefire with Kurdish militants collapsed in July.
