##### Syrian Civil War
# U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron confirms that two ISIS militants, UK citizens, Reyaad Khan and Ruhul Amin, were killed in Syria when a British drone attack hit their car on August 21, 2015. Both Khan and Amin had appeared in an ISIS recruitment video last year. They are alleged to have been plotting a terrorist attack on the UK. 

The father of two Cardiff jihadists thought to have been fighting alongside Reyaad Khan says he fears his sons are on a &quot;hit list&quot;.
