# German airline Lufthansa cancels 84 long-haul flights as pilots go on strike over a proposed restructure plan. 

Deutsche Lufthansa AG pilots will resume striking Tuesday, almost six months after walkouts over cost cuts were halted as management and unions came together in the wake of a deadly crash at the companyâ€™s Germanwings arm.
