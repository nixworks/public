##### Refugee immigration to Germany
# Denmark reopens rail services to Germany after closing rail lines and a motorway in order to stem the flow of migrants on their way to Sweden. 

Denmark has resumed rail services to Germany, after closing the train line and a motorway yesterday in a bid to stem the flow of refugees heading north to Sweden. The motorway, a vital traffic artery for people and goods between the two countries, was closed when some 300 refugees, including children, began walking on it. Police tried to persuade them to leave but appeared reluctant to use force, witnesses said.
