##### Refugee immigration to Germany
# Following Austria's and Germany's decision to waive their asylum system rules, approximately 6,500 migrants - mostly from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan - arrive in Vienna. They traveled from Hungary by bus, train or on foot. The migrants were given the opportunity to register in Austria or move on to Germany. 

The refugees had crossed from Hungary into Austria earlier Saturday as more migrants followed from Budapest.
