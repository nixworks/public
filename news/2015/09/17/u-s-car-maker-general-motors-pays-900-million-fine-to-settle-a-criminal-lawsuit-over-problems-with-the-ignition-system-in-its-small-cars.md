# U.S. car maker General Motors pays $900 million fine to settle a criminal lawsuit over problems with the ignition system in its small cars. 

General Motors admitted it failed to disclose to the public a deadly problem with small-car ignition switches as part of a $900 million deal reached with federal authorities to avoid criminal charges, authorities announced Thursday.
