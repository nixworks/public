# In the second police officer shooting in the city in three days, a man ambushed a marked police SUV stopped at a traffic light in Las Vegas by walking up and firing multiple rounds, striking one officer in the hand. The shooter was arrested. 

A Las Vegas police officer reportedly received non-life-threatening injuries after a gunman approached his squad car and began firing in an “ambush-style” shooting.
