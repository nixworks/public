# A law affecting online personal computer data storage comes into force in Russia. 

As of September 1, Russia has new rules obliging all companies offering internet services to store users’ personal information inside the country. The authorities refused to postpone the bill’s enforcement, but allowed exceptions for some businesses, such as air carriers.
