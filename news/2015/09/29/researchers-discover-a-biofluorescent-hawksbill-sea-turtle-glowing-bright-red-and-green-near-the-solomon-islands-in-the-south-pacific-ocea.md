# Researchers discover a biofluorescent hawksbill sea turtle, glowing bright red and green, near the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. This is the first time scientists have found biofluorescence in a reptile in the wild. The hawksbill sea turtle is an endangered species. 

A brightly glowing neon green and red sea turtle caught the attention of two divers filming biofluorescent creatures near the Solomon Islands.
