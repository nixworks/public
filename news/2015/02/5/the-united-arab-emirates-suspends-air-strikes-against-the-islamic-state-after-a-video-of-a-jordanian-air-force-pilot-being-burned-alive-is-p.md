# The United Arab Emirates suspends air strikes against the Islamic State after a video of a Jordanian air force pilot being burned alive is published online. The suspension involves concerns over a lack of coalition search and rescue capabilities in Syria to recover downed pilots. 

The United Arab Emirates stops combat missions over Syria because the U.S. wasn&#x27;t able to rescue a Jordanian pilot burned to death in an ISIS video.
