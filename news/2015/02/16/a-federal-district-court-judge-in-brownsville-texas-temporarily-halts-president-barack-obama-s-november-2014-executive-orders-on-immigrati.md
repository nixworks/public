##### U.S. District Court Judge
# A Federal District Court judge in Brownsville, Texas, temporarily halts President Barack Obama's November 2014 executive orders on immigration, allowing Texas and 25 other states to file a lawsuit opposing the orders. The Department of Justice indicated it will appeal. 

President Obama vowed to appeal a federal judge’s decision to block his administration’s sweeping immigration plan.
