Several business groups, such as the National Retail Federation, the Associated Builders and Contractors, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, object because the rule limits employers' free speech rights to counter union organizing, it could interfere with attorney-client privilege, etc. Court challenges are expected. ](/news/2016/03/23/the-u-s-labor-department-releases-a-long-awaited-rule-the-so-called-persuader-rule-that-was-first-proposed-in-2011-the-regulation-require.md) _Context: National Retail Federation_
