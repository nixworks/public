##### Willacy County Correctional Center
# The Willacy County Correctional Center in Willacy County, Texas is emptied of thousands of inmates the day after a riot makes it uninhabitable. 

Up to 2,800 other prisoners will be moved to other facilities, as talks continue with several hundred inmates who took control of part of a prison.
