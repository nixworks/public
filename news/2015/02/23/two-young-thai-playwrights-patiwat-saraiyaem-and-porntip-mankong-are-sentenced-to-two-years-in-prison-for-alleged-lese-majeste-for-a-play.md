# Two young Thai playwrights, Patiwat Saraiyaem and Porntip Mankong, are sentenced to two years in prison for alleged lese majeste for a play set in a fictional kingdom. 

Two young Thais accused of defaming the monarchy in a university play were jailed for two and a half years on Monday, as the ruling junta intensifies a crackdown under a controversial lese majeste law.
