# An airstrike by the U.S.-led coalition hit Iraqi forces as the  army engaged militants in poor weather conditions south of the city of Fallujah. Official reports state one soldier was killed, and nine were injured, but casualties may be significantly higher. A military medic says he's  treated at least 20 for injuries. 

This is the first friendly fire report by the country&rsquo;s armed forces since U.S. airstrikes on the Islamic State began.
