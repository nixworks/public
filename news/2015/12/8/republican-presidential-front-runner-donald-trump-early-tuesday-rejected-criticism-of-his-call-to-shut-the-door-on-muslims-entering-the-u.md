# Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump early Tuesday rejected criticism of his call to "shut the door" on Muslims entering the U.S. during a heated round of interviews in which he said he was not worried about being compared to Hitler. 

Trump stressed that his plan to prevent Muslims from entering the U.S. was &quot;temporary.&quot;
