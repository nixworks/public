##### Los Angeles Unified School District
# Schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District close after receiving an unspecified "electronic" threat. Later, authorities conclude the threat was a hoax, and announce schools will reopen Wednesday. New York City schools' initial response to a similar threatening email was to treat it as a hoax. The emails were largely identical and had been routed through a server in Frankfurt, apparently by the same person. 

More than 1,000 schools in Los Angeles are closed and being searched after receiving an unspecified email threat, say US police.
