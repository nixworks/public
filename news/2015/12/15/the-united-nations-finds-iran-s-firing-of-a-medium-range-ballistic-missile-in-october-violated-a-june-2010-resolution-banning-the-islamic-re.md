# The United Nations finds Iran's firing of a medium-range ballistic missile in October violated a June 2010 resolution banning the Islamic Republic from launches capable of delivering nuclear weapons. The test was not technically a violation of the July nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers. It's not known if the Security Council will take any action. 

United Nations experts said in a new report on Tuesday the launch used ballistic missile technology banned under a June 2010 resolution.
