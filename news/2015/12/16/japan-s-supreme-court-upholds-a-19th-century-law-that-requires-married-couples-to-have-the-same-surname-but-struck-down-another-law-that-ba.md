# Japan's Supreme Court upholds a 19th-century law that requires married couples to have the same surname, but struck down another law that barred women from remarrying within six months of a divorce as unconstitutional. 

Court decision is a setback for campaigners who argued 19th-century law violates civil rights and in practice forces women to take their husband’s name
