##### North Korean (DPRK) supreme court
# The North Korean (DPRK) supreme court convicts and sentences South Korea-born Canadian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim to hard labor for life for trying to overthrow the DPRK and undermine the country's social system. Lim's relatives said he's traveled to North Korea more than 100 times since 1997, to help people, but not for any particular political purpose. Lim, from the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Toronto, has been in custody since February. 

Clergyman arrested in February was previously shown in video released by regime propaganda channel saying he had ‘defamed and insulted’ the state
