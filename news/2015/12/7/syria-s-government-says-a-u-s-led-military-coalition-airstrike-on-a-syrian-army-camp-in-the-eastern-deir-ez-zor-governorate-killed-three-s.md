##### Syrian Civil War
# Syria's government says a U.S.-led military coalition airstrike on a Syrian Army camp in the eastern Deir ez-Zor Governorate, killed three Syrian soldiers and wounded 13 others. A senior U.S. military official denied responsibility for the airstrike and said that the U.S. is certain it was a Russian airstrike. 

At least 26 civilians, including children, have been killed in north-east Syria by air strikes possibly carried out by the US-led coalition, a monitoring group says.
