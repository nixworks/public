##### Supreme Court of the United States
# The United States Supreme Court declines ("Friedman v. Highland Park") to review the ability of cities and states to prohibit semiautomatic, high-capacity assault weapons that have been used in some of the nation's most deadly recent mass shootings. The nationwide assault weapons ban law expired in 2004. Since the "District of Columbia v. Heller" decision in 2008 found the Second Amendment provides the right for an individual to keep a weapon in the home, the court has avoided all cases that might clarify if that right is more expansive. 

Gun rights advocates are frustrated that the justices won&rsquo;t address laws restricting gun ownership.
