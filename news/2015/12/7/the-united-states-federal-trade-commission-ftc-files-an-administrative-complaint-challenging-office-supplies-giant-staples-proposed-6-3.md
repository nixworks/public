##### U.S.
#  The United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) files an administrative complaint challenging office-supplies giant Staples' proposed $6.3 billion acquisition of top rival Office Depot. The FTC said the deal would significantly reduce national competition in the market for office supplies sold to large business customers. The companies plan to contest the FTC decision. 

Staples Inc. will face a challenge by U.S. antitrust officials, who said the office supply chain&apos;s proposed takeover of Office Depot Inc. should be blocked.
