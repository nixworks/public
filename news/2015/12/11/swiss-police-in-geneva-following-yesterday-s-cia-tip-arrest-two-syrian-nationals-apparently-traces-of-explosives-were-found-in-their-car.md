# Swiss police in Geneva, following yesterday's CIA tip, arrest two Syrian nationals. Apparently, traces of explosives were found in their car. President Simonetta Sommaruga says, "There is currently no indication that there was a concrete attack planned." 

Explosive traces are discovered in a car in Geneva, say media reports, as the city is put on a high security alert.
