# Two of the U.S.'s oldest and largest companies, DuPont and Dow Chemical Company, will merge in an all-stock deal valued at $130 billion.

Chemical titans DuPont and Dow Chemical Co have agreed to combine in an all-stock merger valued at $130 billion in a first step toward breaking up into three separate businesses, a move that pleased activist investors and could trigger more consolidation.
