# The Iraqi government, via state TV, requests all civilians leave the ISIL-held city of Ramadi in Anbar province, after several days of U.S.-led coalition airstrikes against ISIL. Observers speculate this request precedes major ground operations to retake Ramadi, which fell to ISIL in May. 

A military statement has ordered civilians to leave the &quot;Islamic State&quot;-held city, without giving further details. Some analysts believe a major US-led operation to retake the city is imminent.
