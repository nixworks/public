##### Legionnaires' disease
# One of three people who contracted Legionnaires' disease in Hannibal, Missouri, dies, according to health officials. Hannibal is about 20 miles from Quincy, Illinois, where a Legionnaires' outbreak occurred earlier this year, contributing to 12 deaths and sickening dozens more. 

Illinois officials admit they were caught off-guard by the wave of Legionnaires&#39; at their veterans&#39; home in Quincy.
