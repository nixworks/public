# While voters in Central African Republic cast their ballots in a constitutional referendum aimed at ending years of sectarian strife, clashes erupt in the capital Bangui's PK5 Muslim neighborhood, killing at least two and injuring over 20. PK5 residents, visited by Pope Francis two weeks ago, marched to the U.N. headquarters in the country to complain they were unable to cast their ballots. The proposed constitution would limit a president to two terms, add an upper house to go along with the National Assembly, and fight institutional corruption. 

Two&#x20;people&#x20;were&#x20;killed&#x20;Sunday&#x20;as&#x20;heavy&#x20;weapons&#x20;fire&#x20;and&#x20;clashes&#x20;in&#x20;the&#x20;Muslim&#x20;district&#x20;of&#x20;Bangui,&#x20;the&#x20;Central&#x20;African&#x20;Republic&#x20;capital,&#x20;marred&#x20;a&#x20;key&#x20;constitutional&#x20;referendum&#x20;aimed&#x20;at&#x20;ending&#x20;years&#x20;of&#x20;sectarian&#x20;strife.
