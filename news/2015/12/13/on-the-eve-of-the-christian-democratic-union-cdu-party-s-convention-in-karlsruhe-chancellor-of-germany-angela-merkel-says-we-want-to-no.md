##### European migration crisis
# On the eve of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party's convention in Karlsruhe, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel says, "We want to noticeably reduce the number of people who come to us, but not through unilateral national measures alone." She acknowledges the crisis could overwhelm Germany if it went on much longer. Merkel warded off pressure from immigration skeptics within the CDU to include a quota in the refugee policy motion the convention will vote on. 

German Chancellor Angela Merkel faces critics of her refugee policy armed with a vote of confidence by senior members of her Christian Democratic Union, lessening the chances of an open revolt.
