##### Harvard Law School
# Harvard Law School officials are reviewing the use of the school's seal that includes three bushels of wheat, which also appears on Isaac Royall's family coat of arms. Royall, a slaveholder whose father was known to be a cruel owner, left part of his estate to help found the law school. 

The seal of Harvard Law School uses the code of arms of a slaveholding family that donated part of its estate to help create the school.
