##### Military intervention against ISIL
# The United Kingdom's Royal Air Force bombs Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-controlled oil wells in eastern Syria. At least four Tornado GR4 fighter jets, operating out of RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, were involved in raids. The Ministry of Defence said initial analysis "indicates that the strikes were successful". 

David Cameron says Britain&#039;s air war will require &quot;patience and persistence&quot;, as RAF planes bomb an Islamic State oilfield.
