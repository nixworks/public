# Israel's Holocaust and Remembrance Center posthumously adds U.S. Army Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds to the list of the Righteous Among the Nations for his actions in 1945 at a Nazi prisoner of war camp. 

When Germans at a Nazi camp demanded that Jewish POWs identify themselves, Roddie Edmonds — the highest-ranking American there — ordered every soldier to step forward. &quot;We are all Jews,&quot; he said.
