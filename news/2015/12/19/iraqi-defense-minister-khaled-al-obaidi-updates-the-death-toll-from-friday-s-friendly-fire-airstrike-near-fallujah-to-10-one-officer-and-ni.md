##### U.S. airstrikes
# Iraqi Defense Minister Khaled al-Obaidi updates the death toll from Friday's friendly fire airstrike near Fallujah to 10, one officer and nine soldiers. U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter says it appears an American jet conducted the strike. Carter called Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to express condolences. 

The incident is likely to be used for political gain by critics of U.S. military assistance in Iraq, including the country&rsquo;s Iranian-backed Shiite militias.
