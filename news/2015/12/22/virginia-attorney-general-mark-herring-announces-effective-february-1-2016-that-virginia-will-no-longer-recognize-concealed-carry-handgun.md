# Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring announces, effective February 1, 2016, that Virginia will no longer recognize concealed carry handgun permits from 25 (of the 30) states with reciprocity agreements with the commonwealth whose concealed handgun regulations are weaker than Virginia's. The state agreements with the other five states will not change. Virginia's concealed carry permits will not be recognized by at least six states because they require mutual recognition of permits. 

Attorney general says the state will no longer recognize such handgun permits from 25 states with reciprocity agreements.
