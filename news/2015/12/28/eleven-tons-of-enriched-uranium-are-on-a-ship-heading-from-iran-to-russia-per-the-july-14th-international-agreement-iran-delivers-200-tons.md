# Eleven tons of enriched uranium are on a ship heading from Iran to Russia, per the July 14th international agreement. Iran delivers 200 tons of Russian yellowcake in return. The International Atomic Energy Agency will decide when Tehran has complied with its obligations which would make dismantling of economic sanctions possible. 

The US says Iran has taken a significant step towards meeting its nuclear commitments, by sending a large quantity of uranium abroad.
