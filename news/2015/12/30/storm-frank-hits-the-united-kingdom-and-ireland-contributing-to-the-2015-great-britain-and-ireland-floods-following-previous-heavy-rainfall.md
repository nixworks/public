##### 2015-16 UK and Ireland windstorm season
# Storm Frank hits the United Kingdom and Ireland, contributing to the 2015 Great Britain and Ireland floods following previous heavy rainfall. 

High winds caused by Storm Frank have resulted in long delays at Belfast airport. As well as departures, travellers also faced a wait to disembark from nine flights as wind speeds reached 55 knots (63mph). The conditions meant it was not immediately possible to get aircraft access steps into place. Some passengers reportedly faced delays of up to 10 hours as flights were grounded. The airport said the disruption would have a knock-on effect on scheduled departures to Gatwick, Glasgow, Bristol, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Manchester. Jack Graham, who was delayed at Belfast for five hours, told ITV News there had been a lack of information for those waiting. Describing the mood among passengers as &quot;absolutely dreadful&quot;, he said: &quot;There are no easyJet staff anywhere, no managers on site.&quot;
