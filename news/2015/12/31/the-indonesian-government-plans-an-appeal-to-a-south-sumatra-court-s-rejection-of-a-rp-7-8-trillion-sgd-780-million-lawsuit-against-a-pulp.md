# The Indonesian government plans an appeal to a South Sumatra court's rejection of a Rp 7.8 trillion (SGD 780 million) lawsuit against a pulp and paper company accused of contributing to the recurring Southeast Asian hazes, particularly the recent incident of hazes in 2015. 

The Indonesian government says it will appeal a court decision to reject a $565m (£381m) lawsuit against a plantation company accused of causing forest fires.
