# Thousands, including families, children, and miners from around the country, march from Knottingley to North Yorkshire to mark the end of deep coal mining in the United Kingdom. The last facility, Kellingley Colliery in Beal, North Yorkshire, closed down, Friday, 18 December 2015. The march was organized by two miners' wives to pay tribute to this industry. 

More than three thousand people united in a march to mark the closure of Kellingley Collieryâ€™s mine in North Yorkshire and the end of British deep coal mining. Families, children and miners from around the country joined the march - which folllowed the mine&#039;s final working day on Friday - from Knottingley Town Hall in West Yorkshire to the Kellingley Miners Welfare social club. People lined the streets in support, cheering and applauding as the miners walked the mile-long route.
