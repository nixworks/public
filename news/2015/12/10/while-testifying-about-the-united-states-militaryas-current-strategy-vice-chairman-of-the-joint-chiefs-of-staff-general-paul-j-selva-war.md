##### Military intervention against ISIL
# While testifying about the United States military's current strategy, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul J. Selva warns the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) against falling into a ground fight trap with ISIL and U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter cautions that increased U.S. ground presence will "Americanize" the conflict. The Daily Beast reports that both Pentagon officials "did little to assuage lawmakers' concerns that the strategy isn't working.'' At the same time, former U.S. defense officials tell SASC the current approach is inadequate. 

It’s not just Obama’s critics in Congress who think he can’t defeat the Islamic State. Defense officials also say his plan will fail.
