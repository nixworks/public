# A Wisconsin gun shop, which a jury found negligently sold the gun an assailant used to injure two Milwaukee police officers to a straw buyer, reaches a $1 million settlement with the officers. 

A Milwaukee gun store will pay $1 million to settle a case with two police officers who were shot with a handgun that it allowed to be acquired illegally in 2009, issuing a rare legal defeat for the gun industry, local media reported on Friday.
